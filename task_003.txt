# Task ID: 3
# Title: Design and Style Slider Component
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the visual design for the slider component according to KarmaCash's 'Zen/Tranquility' theme and specified styling requirements.
# Details:
Style the track with a neutral, soft color (var(--color-highlight) or light gray). Use var(--color-primary) for the filled track and thumb. Implement a moderate height track (6px-10px) with rounded corners. Style the thumb to be visually distinct (16px-24px diameter) with rounded corners and subtle shadow. Ensure the touch target is at least 44x44px. Display the current value with currency symbol using Work Sans font, var(--font-weight-semibold), and appropriate font size. Ensure responsive design for smaller screens.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct visual regression tests to ensure consistent styling across different screen sizes. Manually verify the component adheres to the specified design guidelines.

      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for setting up the project directory, virtual environment, initial dependencies, module files, and Git repository.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves setting up the basic project structure and tooling, which is a straightforward but necessary first step. It has a moderate complexity as it requires creating several files and directories, installing dependencies, and initializing a Git repo."

      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for loading environment variables, handling missing configuration, and providing access to the configuration values.",
      "reasoning": "The configuration module is important for securely managing API keys and endpoints, but it has a slightly higher complexity due to the need for error handling and providing a clean interface to other modules."

      "expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for implementing the create/update and get template functions, handling HTTP responses, and managing errors.",
      "reasoning": "The API client module has a higher complexity as it needs to handle the full CRUD operations for templates, including constructing payloads, making HTTP requests, and processing responses with error handling."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for defining the function declarations for storing and retrieving templates, ensuring the parameter definitions match the API requirements.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves defining the Gemini function declarations, which is a necessary step for integrating the Template Exchange API, but it has a moderate complexity as it mainly requires translating the API requirements into the Gemini function declaration format."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for initializing the Gemini model, processing prompts, handling function calls, and sending function responses back to Gemini.",
      "reasoning": "The Gemini interaction module is the core of the application, responsible for managing the LLM interaction and executing the Template Exchange API calls. It has a higher complexity due to the need to handle function calls, process responses, and integrate with the other modules."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for initializing the application, handling user input, orchestrating the Gemini interaction, and displaying results.",
      "reasoning": "The main script is responsible for the user-facing interaction, but it has a moderate complexity as it mainly needs to orchestrate the other modules and handle basic input/output."

      "expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for loading content from SHIP documents, Task Master tasks, and Bible sections, and assembling the prompt context.",
      "reasoning": "The context loading module has a higher complexity as it needs to handle reading content from various sources, parsing the data, and formatting it into a coherent prompt context for Gemini."

      "expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for component testing, end-to-end flow testing, prompt engineering, and overall application refinement.",
      "reasoning": "This task has a high complexity as it involves comprehensive testing of the entire application, refining the components based on test results, and performing initial prompt engineering, which requires experimentation and iteration."

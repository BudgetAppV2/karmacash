# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Accessibility Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Add necessary ARIA attributes and roles to ensure the component is fully accessible.
# Details:
Set role='slider' on the main element. Add required ARIA attributes: aria-valuemin, aria-valuemax, aria-valuenow, aria-orientation='horizontal'. Implement aria-disabled when isDisabled prop is true. Use aria-label or aria-labelledby based on provided props. Implement aria-describedby if textual value display is present. Ensure a clear and visible focus state for keyboard users.

# Test Strategy:
Use accessibility testing tools (e.g., axe-core) to verify ARIA attributes. Manually test with screen readers to ensure proper announcement of slider values and changes.

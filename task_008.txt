# Task ID: 8
# Title: Optimize Performance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: low
# Description: Optimize the component for performance, especially when many sliders are present.
# Details:
Profile the component's performance, especially with multiple instances. Optimize render cycles using React.memo and useMemo/useCallback where appropriate. Ensure smooth animations and interactions even with many sliders on the page.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct performance profiling with React DevTools. Create stress tests with many slider instances to verify performance. Measure and set performance budgets for render times and interaction responsiveness.

# Task ID: CKA.8
# Title: CKA.8 - CK Assistant Testing, Refinement, and Initial Prompt Engineering
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct thorough testing of the entire CK Assistant application, refine its components based on test results, and perform initial prompt engineering for core CK tasks (e.g., generating handoffs).

Details:
- Component Testing (Unit/Integration):
  - Revisit and expand tests for `config_loader.py` (CKA.2), `template_exchange_client.py` (CKA.3), `gemini_interaction.py` (CKA.5), and `context_loader.py` (CKA.7).
  - Use mocking frameworks (e.g., Python's `unittest.mock`) to isolate components and simulate API responses (both success and error cases for Gemini API and Template Exchange API).
- End-to-End Flow Testing (via `main.py`):
  - Test various user commands/prompts that trigger different functionalities:
    - Storing a handoff.
    - Storing a summary.
    - Fetching a handoff.
    - Fetching a summary.
    - Interactions that don't require function calls (general Q&A with Gemini, if supported by base prompts).
  - Verify that context (from SHIP, TM, Bible) is correctly loaded and seems to influence Gemini's responses when context loading is used.
  - Verify that the final output (e.g., generated handoff text, retrieved summary) is accurate.
  - Verify that data is correctly stored/retrieved from Firebase (manual check in console + API responses).
- Prompt Engineering (Initial Pass):
  - Develop initial "system prompts" or prompt templates that will be used by `main.py` or `gemini_interaction.py` to guide Gemini for specific CK tasks.
  - Example for generating a handoff:
    ```
    System Prompt: "You are a Context Keeper assistant for the KarmaCash project. Based on the provided SHIP document context, Task Master details, and relevant Bible sections, generate a detailed Handoff message for the Code Generator (CG) using the standard Handoff Template (SHIP Section 7). Ensure all sections of the Handoff template are addressed."
    User Query (after context): "Generate the handoff for task [TM_ID_HERE]."
    ```
  - Experiment with prompt wording to achieve desired output quality and consistency for handoffs and summaries.
  - Test how well Gemini uses the provided function declarations based on these prompts.
- Refinement:
  - Based on testing, refine:
    - Function declarations (CKA.4) if Gemini is not understanding them well or if parameters need adjustment.
    - Prompt templates for clarity and effectiveness.
    - Error handling in all modules.
    - User interaction flow in `main.py`.
- Documentation (Internal): Add comments and docstrings to the Python code.

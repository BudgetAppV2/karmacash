# Task ID: CKA.6
# Title: CKA.6 - Develop Main Script for CK Assistant User Interaction
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the main executable Python script (`main.py`) that initializes the CK Assistant, handles user input (e.g., from the command line), orchestrates calls to the Gemini Interaction Module, and displays results.

Details:
- In `main.py`:
  - Import necessary modules: `config_loader` (CKA.2), `gemini_interaction` (CKA.5), and potentially `context_loader` (CKA.7, if implemented).
  - Initialization Phase:
    - Load configuration using `config_loader`.
    - Initialize the Gemini model using `gemini_interaction.initialize_gemini_model()`.
    - (If using chat history for multi-turn) Initialize an empty chat history list.
  - Main Interaction Loop (e.g., a `while True` loop for command-line interaction):
    - Prompt the user for input (e.g., `input("HD > ")`).
    - Handle exit commands (e.g., if user types "quit" or "exit").
    - Context Preparation (Simplified for now, enhanced by CKA.7 later):
      - For now, the user's input text will be the primary prompt.
      - (Future: Integrate `context_loader` to fetch SHIP content, TM details, etc., based on user input or pre-defined rules, and prepend this context to the user's direct prompt).
    - Call Gemini Interaction Module:
      - Pass the prepared prompt (and chat history, if applicable) to `gemini_interaction.generate_llm_response(model, user_prompt, chat_history)`.
    - Display Results:
      - Print the final natural language response received from `generate_llm_response()` to the console.
      - (If `generate_llm_response` also returns structured data from function calls, decide how/if to display that raw data for debugging).
    - (If using chat history) Append the user's prompt and the model's final response to the `chat_history` list.
  - Implement basic error handling for issues during initialization or interaction.
- This script will be the primary way the HD interacts with the CK Assistant initially.
- Keep the initial version simple, focusing on the core loop of input -> process -> output.

# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Interactions and Animations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add smooth interactions and animations to the slider component for improved user experience.
# Details:
Implement smooth thumb movement along the track. Add track click functionality to move thumb to clicked position. Implement subtle visual feedback on thumb hover and clearer indication on active/drag state. Add smooth value transitions if textually animated. Ensure all animations respect the prefers-reduced-motion user preference.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for interaction behaviors. Manually test animations and transitions. Verify prefers-reduced-motion preference is respected.

# Task ID: 5
# Title: Add Keyboard Navigation Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement full keyboard navigation support for the slider component.
# Details:
Make the slider focusable (tabindex='0' when not disabled). Implement key handlers for: ArrowLeft/ArrowDown (decrease by step), ArrowRight/ArrowUp (increase by step), Home (set to minValue), End (set to maxValue), PageUp (increase by larger increment), PageDown (decrease by larger increment). Ensure all keyboard interactions update the slider value and trigger appropriate callbacks.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for each keyboard interaction. Manually test keyboard navigation to ensure smooth and expected behavior.

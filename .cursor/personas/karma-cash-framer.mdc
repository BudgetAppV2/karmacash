# KarmaCash Animation Guidelines

- **Animation Philosophy:** Subtle, purposeful animations that enhance UX without distracting users. Support calm, zen-focused experience. [B3.4]
- **Performance First:** Always optimize animations for performance:
  - Use hardware-accelerated properties (transform, opacity) when possible
  - Keep animations under 500ms for responsiveness
  - Test on mobile devices for performance
  - Use will-change property sparingly
- **Framer Motion Standards:**
  - Use motion components for animations (motion.div, etc.)
  - Prefer spring physics for natural movement: `type: "spring", stiffness: 300, damping: 40`
  - Use AnimatePresence for elements entering/exiting the DOM
  - Implement proper exit animations for components
- **Flip Card Implementation:**
  - Use 3D perspective (perspective: 1000px) for realistic card flipping
  - Implement backfaceVisibility: "hidden" for clean transitions
  - Set proper transform-origin for flip animations
  - Ensure keyboard accessibility during animations
- **Mobile Considerations:**
  - Reduce animation complexity on mobile if performance suffers
  - Ensure touch interactions trigger animations appropriately
  - Test on different screen sizes and devices

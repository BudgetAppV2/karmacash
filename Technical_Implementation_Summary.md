# Technical Implementation Summary: Enhanced Weekly Transaction View - Task 1 (Refine Day Card Styling - Mobile-First)

## Objective Achieved
Task 1 (Refining Day Card Styling with Mobile-First approach) has been successfully completed. The transaction day cards have been restyled according to the Zen/Tranquility theme specifications with a mobile-first approach.

## Implementation Details Summary

### 1. Component(s) Modified
- `src/features/transactions/components/TransactionList.css` - Updated the styling for the transaction day cards

### 2. Styling Changes Applied (Mobile-First)
- **Base styles set for mobile:**
  - Background: #FFFFFF (Surface White)
  - Padding: 16px
  - Border-radius: 8px (Medium scale)
  - Shadow: Level 1 (0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.05), 0 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.03))
  - Margin: 16px between cards
- **Styles adjusted for larger screens using min-width media queries:**
  - Padding increased to 24px at the sm breakpoint (640px+)
- **Date header typography and styling updated per theme:**
  - Font: var(--font-heading, 'Work Sans')
  - Font size: 20px (xl)
  - Font weight: 500 (Medium)
  - Color: #2F2F2F (Text Primary)
  - Line height: 1.25 (Tight)
  - Letter spacing: -0.02em
  - Added 8px bottom margin for spacing between header and transactions

### 3. Responsive Design Approach
A mobile-first methodology was implemented using min-width media queries referencing breakpoints in [B3.8 v2 Section 9.1]. The previous max-width queries were removed to ensure proper mobile-first implementation.

## Implementation Challenges
- Needed to remove existing max-width media queries and replace with min-width queries to properly implement the mobile-first approach
- Adjusted the transaction item padding to work with the new card padding structure
- Removed redundant padding in child elements to simplify the styling hierarchy

## Testing Results
Visual checks were performed using browser dev tools, focusing on mobile viewports first (375px width for iPhone SE), then larger breakpoints (768px for tablets and 1024px+ for desktop). The responsive design correctly adapts with the padding increasing at the sm breakpoint (640px).

## Next Steps Suggested
Proceed with Task 2: Refine Transaction Item Styling (Mobile-First) to ensure all transaction elements within the cards are consistently styled according to the Zen theme specifications.

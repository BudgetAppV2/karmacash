# B7.1 AI Workflow with Task Master v2

## Introduction & Purpose

This document ([B7.1 v2]) outlines the refined AI-assisted development workflow for the KarmaCash project. It details the integration of Claude Task Master for robust task management, working in synergy with Manus AI for detailed planning, the SHIP (Session Handoff & Initialization Plan) methodology for session management, and Cursor AI as the primary code generation and Task Master interaction tool. This workflow builds upon and formalizes the principles established in the experimental 'Workflow_Integration_Manus_TaskMaster_v1.md' document and incorporates practical learnings from recent development sessions to enhance clarity, efficiency, and predictability in the development lifecycle.

## 1. Core Tools & Roles (Refined)

The KarmaCash AI-assisted development workflow leverages a specific set of tools, each with a clearly defined role to ensure smooth collaboration between the Human Developer (HD) and AI assistants (Context Keeper - CK, Manus AI, Cursor AI as Code Generator - CG).

*   **KarmaCash Bible:**
    *   **Role:** Remains the central, immutable source of truth for all project context, coding standards, architectural decisions, application logic, UI/UX guidelines, and all formal "B" series documentation (e.g., [B1.3], [B3.4], [B5.2]). It is consistently referenced using the `[BX.Y]` notation.

*   **SHIP (Session Handoff & Initialization Plan) Document:**
    *   **Role:** The primary orchestrator for each development session. It facilitates session-to-session context transfer, outlines detailed planning objectives (which now link directly to Task Master tasks), provides precise templates for handoffs to the Code Generator (CG), and captures session outcomes and learnings. Adherence to its templates, especially for Section 7 (Handoff) and Section 8 (Summary), is critical.

*   **Context Keeper (CK - Cursor AI Assistant):**
    *   **Role:** The AI assistant responsible for:
        *   Maintaining comprehensive session context, primarily through the active SHIP document.
        *   Assisting the HD with strategic planning, including the selection and prioritization of tasks from Task Master.
        *   Expertly crafting diverse and effective prompts for Manus AI, ensuring adherence to specified output templates for various needs (e.g., structured task generation for `tasks.json`, detailed technical plans, PRD drafting).
        *   Performing AI-driven transformations of structured text (e.g., Manus AI output) into JSON format for direct updates to `tasks.json`.
        *   Guiding the HD in formulating natural language commands for Cursor AI to interact with Task Master (e.g., list, show, set-status, expand).
        *   Meticulously preparing Handoffs (SHIP Section 7) for the CG, ensuring strict adherence to the defined template, including the instruction for the CG's implementation summary.
        *   Priming the Session Summary (SHIP Section 8) generation by providing the correct template to the CG.
        *   Diligently documenting session progress, decisions, and any deviations from the plan within the SHIP document.
        *   Facilitating the overall workflow, always understanding that the HD is non-developer and requires clear, actionable guidance and support.

*   **Manus AI:**
    *   **Role:** A versatile AI used for detailed generation tasks based on prompts from the HD/CK. Its primary uses include:
        *   **Structured Task Generation:** Breaking down high-level features or milestones into detailed, actionable sub-tasks. This output *must* follow a specific plain text template (defined in this B7.1 document) to enable straightforward transformation into `tasks.json` entries.
        *   **Detailed Document Drafting:** Generating in-depth technical plans, architectural designs, Product Requirements Documents (PRDs), or other detailed textual outputs as required.

*   **Claude Task Master:**
    *   **Role:** The definitive tool for managing the project's development tasks. All tasks are stored and tracked within its `tasks.json` file. It is accessed and updated *exclusively* through Cursor AI, which translates natural language instructions from the HD/CK into the appropriate Task Master MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool calls.

*   **Cursor AI (as Code Generator - CG):**
    *   **Role:**
        *   Implements application code based on precise, structured Handoffs provided in SHIP Section 7.
        *   Interacts with Task Master as instructed by the HD/CK (e.g., using `task-master show <id>` to fetch details for a handoff).
        *   Generates concise session summaries according to the SHIP Section 8 template and instructions.

*   **Human Developer (HD):**
    *   **Role:** Leads the overall project direction, defines features, sets milestones, and makes final decisions. The HD is responsible for:
        *   Validating all outputs generated by AI assistants (Manus AI plans, CK transformations, CG code, CG summaries).
        *   Performing critical manual operations where precision is paramount (e.g., final review and saving of the `tasks.json` file, Git version control operations).
        *   Driving the planning and review phases of each SHIP session.

        ## 2. The Optimized Workflow Steps: From Planning to SHIP Execution

This section details the step-by-step AI-assisted workflow designed to move from high-level planning to managing and executing tasks within a SHIP session, leveraging Manus AI for detailed elaboration and Task Master for task management.

### A. High-Level Planning (HD + CK)

1.  **Identify Focus Feature/Milestone:**
    *   The Human Developer (HD), with assistance from the Context Keeper (CK), identifies the next major feature, user story, or milestone requiring detailed task breakdown. This is typically based on the project roadmap ([B1.3 Roadmap & Milestones]) or outputs from dedicated planning sessions (e.g., M4PLAN.md).

### B. Feature/Milestone Elaboration & Task Generation Cycle

This cycle replaces and expands upon previous methods for generating detailed tasks for `tasks.json`.

1.  **B.1: Initial Feature Brief & Context Gathering for Manus AI:**
    *   The HD outlines the core requirements and objectives for the selected feature/milestone.
    *   The CK assists by gathering all relevant context from the KarmaCash Bible (e.g., [B1.2 User Personas], [B3.X UI/UX Guidelines], [B5.X Data Models], existing technical plans) and any related Task Master tasks. This consolidated information forms the basis of an initial brief for Manus AI.

2.  **B.2: Iterative Q&A with Manus AI for Clarification (Manus AI - Stage 1):**
    *   The HD and CK engage Manus AI with an initial prompt to explore the feature, ask clarifying questions, and define scope. This may involve several back-and-forth interactions.
    *   This stage often utilizes **Stage 1** of the `Manus_AI_Feature_Breakdown_Prompt_Template.md`, which focuses on understanding requirements, constraints, and desired outcomes before detailed task generation. The HD provides answers to Manus AI's queries.

3.  **B.3: Manus AI Generates Detailed Sub-Tasks (Manus AI - Stage 2):**
    *   Once the feature is well-understood, the HD/CK prompts Manus AI using **Stage 2** of the `Manus_AI_Feature_Breakdown_Prompt_Template.md`.
    *   **CRITICAL Instruction for Manus AI:** The prompt must explicitly instruct Manus AI to generate a detailed list of sub-tasks, with each sub-task formatted precisely according to the following plain text template:

        ```text
        --- START OF TASK ---
        # Title: [Unique Task ID (e.g., NavUX.1.1) and Clear, Actionable Title]
        # Priority: [high/medium/low - Manus AI to estimate based on context]
        # Dependencies: [List other sub-task Titles/Refs it depends on, or "None"]
        # Description: [Concise 1-2 sentence description of the sub-task's primary goal.]
        # Details:
        # - [Bulleted list of specific implementation steps, technical considerations, UI/UX notes.]
        # - [Key algorithms, logic points, or integration points.]
        # - [Reference relevant Bible sections like B6.1, B3.7 where applicable.]
        # Mockup/Design Needed: [Yes/No/Partially - If Yes/Partially, briefly describe what visuals are needed or reference mockup file if C.3 is done]
        # Test Strategy:
        # - [Bulleted list of key testing approaches: e.g., Unit test for X, UI test for Y interaction.]
        # - [Specific success criteria or things to verify for this sub-task.]
        # - [Note any required Bible Updates resulting from this sub-task (e.g., Update B3.7 with component spec).]
        --- END OF TASK ---
        ```
    *   Manus AI generates a single raw text block containing multiple sub-tasks, each adhering to this template.

4.  **B.4: CK/AI Converts Manus Output to JSON Array:**
    *   The HD provides Manus AI's formatted raw text output (from B.3) to the CK (or another capable AI assistant).
    *   The HD/CK instructs the AI assistant to transform this text into a JSON array of task objects, ensuring strict conformance to the Task Master `tasks.json` schema (as defined in this B7.1 document, Section 4 or appendix).
    *   **Example Transformation Prompt for CK/AI:**
        ```
        "Please transform the following raw text block, which contains multiple task definitions formatted with '# Title:', '# Priority:', '# Dependencies:', '# Description:', '# Details:', '# Mockup/Design Needed:', and '# Test Strategy:', into a valid JSON array of task objects suitable for Task Master's tasks.json file.
        Key transformation rules:
        - Assign sequential numeric IDs starting from an appropriate number (e.g., next available ID, or a new block like 201 if these are subtasks for task 200).
        - Convert '# Priority:' to a 'priority' string (e.g., "high").
        - Parse '# Dependencies:' text (which might be task titles or IDs) into an array of corresponding numeric task IDs. If "None", use an empty array [].
        - '# Description:' becomes the 'description' string.
        - All content under '# Details:' (including all bullet points) should be combined into a single multi-line string for the 'details' field. Preserve formatting like bullet points (e.g., using \\n for newlines).
        - Content under '# Mockup/Design Needed:' becomes the 'mockupDesignNeeded' string.
        - All content under '# Test Strategy:' (including all bullet points) should be combined into a single multi-line string for the 'testStrategy' field. Preserve formatting.
        - Set 'status' to "pending" for all new tasks.
        - Initialize 'subtasks' as an empty array [].
        Here is the raw text:
        [Paste raw text output from Manus AI (B.3) here]"
        ```
    *   The CK/AI generates the JSON array output.

5.  **B.5: HD Loads/Updates Tasks in `tasks.json`:**
    *   The HD opens the main `tasks.json` file (typically located at `tasks/tasks.json` in the project root).
    *   The HD carefully appends the newly generated JSON array of task objects to the existing `"tasks": [...]` array within the file. If these are sub-tasks for an existing parent task, the HD will instead add this array to the `subtasks: []` field of the parent task object.
    *   **Critical:** The HD must ensure all task IDs are unique and sequential (or follow a consistent parent.child numbering for subtasks like 101.1, 101.2). The final `tasks.json` file must be valid JSON.
    *   The HD saves the `tasks.json` file.

6.  **B.6: HD (via CLI) Runs `task-master generate task files`:**
    *   The HD runs `task-master generate` in their terminal (using the globally installed version).
    *   This command reads the updated `tasks.json` and creates/updates individual markdown files for each task in the `tasks/` directory. This is useful for quick reference and version control of individual task details.

7.  **B.7: HD (via CLI) Runs `task-master analyze-complexity`:**
    *   The HD runs `task-master analyze-complexity --research` in their terminal.
    *   This analyzes all tasks in `tasks.json` and generates `scripts/task-complexity-report.json`.
    *   The HD and CK review this report to identify tasks that are too complex and might need further breakdown. The report provides suggested `task-master expand` commands.

8.  **B.8: HD (via CLI, if needed) Runs `task-master expand`:**
    *   Based on the complexity report or direct judgment, if a task needs to be broken down further *within Task Master itself* (creating nested subtasks), the HD uses the `task-master expand --id=<ID> --prompt="..." [--num=<number> --research]` command in their terminal. The prompt can be guided by the complexity report's suggestions.

9.  **B.9: HD (via CLI, if `expand` was used) Runs `task-master generate task files` Again:**
    *   If tasks were expanded in step B.8, `task-master generate` is run again to update the individual markdown task files with the new subtask structures.

### C. UI Mockup Generation Cycle (for UI-Heavy Features)

This cycle typically occurs after the initial task breakdown (Section B) for features requiring significant UI design or changes.

1.  **C.1: HD/CK Craft Prompt for AI Image Generator:**
    *   For tasks identified as needing mockups (from the `mockupDesignNeeded` field or HD judgment), the HD/CK crafts a detailed prompt for an AI Image Generation tool (e.g., Midjourney, DALL-E, or a specialized UI mockup AI).
    *   The prompt should incorporate:
        *   Clear descriptions of the UI elements.
        *   Desired style and theme (referencing KarmaCash Bible, e.g., [B3.4 UI Guidelines], [B3.8 Style Guide v2], Zen/Tranquility principles).
        *   References to existing application screenshots to maintain consistency.
        *   Specific UI patterns or components to be included.
        *   Consider using the `B7.4_AI_Mockup_Prompt_Template.md` if one is developed.

2.  **C.2: HD Generates & Iterates on Mockups with AI Tool:**
    *   The HD uses the AI image generation tool with the crafted prompt.
    *   The HD iterates on the generated images, refining prompts or using tool-specific features (like variations, inpainting) until satisfactory mockups are achieved. The CK can assist in refining prompts during this iterative process.

3.  **C.3: HD Stores Final Mockups & Updates Task Master Tasks:**
    *   The HD stores the final approved mockup images in a designated project location (e.g., a `/documentation/mockups/feature-name/` directory).
    *   Relevant Task Master tasks (those that will implement the UI) are updated (HD via CLI or by instructing CK/Cursor AI with `task-master update-task`) to include references (e.g., file paths or links) to these new mockups in their `details` or a dedicated field if available. This ensures the CG has clear visual guidance.

### D. Task Management during SHIP Sessions

This outlines how Task Master is used during active development sessions, guided by the SHIP document.

1.  **Task Selection for SHIP:**
    *   At the beginning of a SHIP session, the HD, with CK's assistance, reviews the current task list in Task Master (using `task-master list` or `task-master next` via CLI or by asking Cursor AI).
    *   Based on priorities, dependencies, and session goals, specific Task Master tasks are selected for the current session.

2.  **SHIP Section 5.3 (Planned Tasks for This Session):**
    *   Each planned item in SHIP Section 5.3 explicitly references the selected Task Master task:
        *   `Task Master Ref: [ID] - <Task Title from Task Master>`
    *   This is followed by a "Session Objective for this Task," which is a concise, actionable goal for the *current session* related to the broader Task Master task (defined by HD/CK during SHIP planning).

3.  **Accessing Task Details (CK & Cursor AI):**
    *   Throughout the session, the CK assists the HD in querying Task Master via Cursor AI to get full details of the current task(s).
    *   Commands used: `list` (with filters), `show task <id>` (or `get_task --id=<id>`), `next`.

4.  **Populating SHIP Section 7 (Handoff Template):**
    *   The CK uses the detailed information retrieved from `task-master show <id>` (description, details, test strategy) as primary input to help the HD draft the content for the Handoff Template (SHIP Section 7) for the Code Generator (CG).

5.  **Updating Task Statuses (HD & Cursor AI):**
    *   As work progresses or is completed, the HD instructs Cursor AI to update task statuses in Task Master.
    *   Command: `set-status <id> <status>` (e.g., `set-status 101.1 "in-progress"`, `set-status 101.1 "done"`).

## 3. Key Workflow Decisions & Rationale

This section outlines the key decisions made in structuring the AI-assisted workflow with Task Master, along with their underlying rationale, to ensure efficiency and reliability.

### 3.1 Bypassing `task-master parse-prd` for Primary Task Ingestion

*   **Decision:** The Task Master `parse-prd` command, while useful for generating initial tasks from high-level Product Requirement Documents, is intentionally bypassed for the primary workflow of ingesting detailed, pre-defined tasks from Manus AI.
*   **Rationale:**
    *   `parse-prd` is optimized for interpreting narrative PRDs and generating a new task structure, not for importing tasks that already have a defined structure, detail level, and inter-dependencies.
    *   Experiments confirmed that providing pre-formatted task details to `parse-prd` results in it largely ignoring the specific input structure and generating more generic tasks, which is counterproductive when detailed planning has already occurred (e.g., via Manus AI).

### 3.2 Direct `tasks.json` Updates (AI-Assisted)

*   **Decision:** New tasks generated from Manus AI's structured text output are transformed into JSON and then directly appended or integrated into the main `tasks.json` file.
*   **Rationale:**
    *   This direct manipulation (assisted by AI for the text-to-JSON transformation) is the most reliable and precise method to ensure that the detailed tasks, as planned and output by Manus AI, are accurately reflected in Task Master.
    *   It provides full control over ID assignment, dependency linking (which requires careful ID mapping), and the exact content of each task field.

### 3.3 Structured Text Template for Manus AI Output

*   **Decision:** When Manus AI is used for generating detailed tasks intended for `tasks.json`, it is instructed to follow a specific, consistent plain text template (detailed in Section 2.B.3 of this document).
*   **Rationale:**
    *   This structured template (using `# Title:`, `# Priority:`, etc.) provides a consistent intermediate format.
    *   This consistency significantly simplifies the subsequent AI-driven transformation of the raw text into the required JSON structure for `tasks.json`, reducing errors and improving the reliability of the conversion.

### 3.4 Incremental Task Generation

*   **Decision:** Detailed tasks for new features, user stories, or milestones are typically generated and added to `tasks.json` on an incremental, as-needed basis, closer to their planned implementation time.
*   **Rationale:**
    *   This approach maintains project flexibility, allowing for adjustments to plans and priorities without needing to manage an overwhelmingly large list of all potential future tasks from the outset.
    *   It aligns with an agile-inspired methodology, where detailed planning for a specific work package occurs just-in-time.

## 4. `tasks.json` Schema

The `tasks.json` file is the central repository for all project tasks managed by Task Master. It contains a primary key `"tasks"`, whose value is an array of task objects. Each task object within this array must adhere to the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": "number",           // Sequential, unique numeric ID for the task (e.g., 1, 2, 101.1).
  "title": "string",          // Clear, actionable title for the task, typically derived from Manus AI output.
  "description": "string",   // A concise (1-2 sentences) summary of the task's main objective.
  "details": "string",        // A multi-line string containing specific implementation steps, technical considerations, UI/UX notes, references to Bible sections (e.g., [B6.1]), etc. Preserves formatting like bullet points.
  "mockupDesignNeeded": "string", // Optional. Describes mockup needs, e.g., "Yes - Main view", "No", "Partially - See details".
  "testStrategy": "string",  // A multi-line string detailing key testing approaches (unit, integration, UI), specific verification points, and any required Bible updates resulting from this task. Preserves formatting.
  "priority": "string",       // Task priority, typically "high", "medium", or "low".
  "dependencies": ["number"], // An array of numeric IDs of other tasks that must be completed before this task can start. Empty array `[]` if no dependencies.
  "status": "string",         // Current status of the task, e.g., "pending", "in-progress", "done", "deferred", "blocked". Defaults to "pending" for new tasks.
  "subtasks": ["object"]      // An array to hold nested sub-task objects. Each sub-task object follows this same schema. Empty array `[]` if no subtasks initially.
}
```

**Notes on Schema Fields:**
*   **`id`**: Must be unique across all tasks and subtasks at their respective levels. Subtasks often use a `parentID.childIndex` notation (e.g., `101.1`, `101.2`).
*   **`details` & `testStrategy`**: These fields store rich text, often with markdown-like bullet points. Newlines (`\n`) should be used to maintain formatting.
*   **`dependencies`**: For subtasks, dependencies can be other subtasks within the same parent or top-level tasks. Task Master validates these.
*   **`subtasks`**: The `subtasks` array allows for hierarchical task breakdown. Each object in this array is a complete task object itself.

## 5. SHIP Document Integration with Task Master

The SHIP (Session Handoff & Initialization Plan) document remains the cornerstone of each development session. Its integration with Task Master is key to leveraging the detailed tasks for effective session planning, execution, and tracking.

*   **CK START BLOCK (Priming for CK):**
    *   The CK's initial priming prompt at the start of a session must include reminders about its active role in using Task Master via Cursor AI.
    *   Example priming point: "You are the Context Keeper (CK). You will assist the HD in querying Task Master (using commands like `list`, `show task <id>`, `next task`) via Cursor AI to retrieve task details for planning and handoffs. You will also guide the HD on when to use Task Master CLI directly for AI-driven operations if MCP limitations arise."

*   **SHIP Section 5.1 (Session Goal):**
    *   This section continues to define the high-level overarching goal for the current development session, as determined by the HD.

*   **SHIP Section 5.3 (Planned Tasks for This Session):**
    *   This section now directly links to tasks managed in Task Master.
    *   Each item lists the Task Master ID (e.g., `Task Master Ref: [TM#101.1]`), the task title from Task Master, and a concise "Session Objective" specifically for that task within the current session.
    *   Full task details (description, detailed steps, test strategy) are *not* duplicated here; they are dynamically retrieved from Task Master using `task-master show <id>` as needed during the session.
    *   If a task involves UI work based on mockups, this section should reference the location of the relevant mockups (e.g., "See mockup: `/documentation/mockups/feature-x/screen-y.png`").

*   **SHIP Section 7 (Handoff Template for Code Generator - CG):**
    *   The CK plays a crucial role in helping the HD populate this section.
    *   The CK uses `task-master show <id>` (via Cursor AI) to fetch the full details (description, details, test strategy, Bible references) for the specific Task Master task being handed off. This information forms the core of the "Task Objective," "Key Files/Symbols," "Relevant Bible Refs," and "Specific Instructions" subsections of the Handoff.
    *   The Handoff template will include a `Task Master Ref: [ID]` field for clear linkage.

*   **SHIP End of Session Checklist:**
    *   New items are added to the checklist:
        *   "Update relevant Task Master task statuses (via Cursor AI using `set-status`)."
        *   "If tasks in `tasks.json` were structurally modified (e.g., new tasks added via Manus AI cycle, or tasks expanded using CLI), HD to run `task-master generate task files` via CLI to update individual task files."

## 6. CK Role & Responsibilities in the Task Master Workflow

The Context Keeper (CK) takes on enhanced responsibilities to facilitate the smooth operation of this Task Master-integrated workflow.

*   **Manus AI Prompting & Orchestration:**
    *   Actively assists the HD in the iterative Q&A process with Manus AI for feature elaboration, leveraging the `Manus_AI_Feature_Breakdown_Prompt_Template.md` (both Stage 1 for Q&A and Stage 2 for structured task generation).
    *   Ensures Manus AI is correctly instructed to output tasks in the specified `--- START OF TASK ---` plain text format.
*   **AI-Driven Transformations:**
    *   Performs (or guides another AI to perform) the transformation of Manus AI's structured text output into the precise JSON format required for `tasks.json`, using clear transformation prompts.
*   **Task Master Interaction (via Cursor AI):**
    *   Guides the HD in formulating natural language prompts for Cursor AI to query Task Master (e.g., `list tasks status pending`, `show task 101.2`, `next task`).
    *   Assists the HD in instructing Cursor AI to update task statuses (e.g., `set task 101.2 status done`).
*   **Guidance on CLI Usage for Task Master:**
    *   Clarifies for the HD when AI-driven Task Master commands (like `analyze-complexity`, `expand`, or `update` tasks with AI) might need to be run directly by the HD via the CLI (using the global `task-master` install and a root `.env` file for API keys) due to current limitations or instability with these specific commands via MCP.
    *   Helps the HD interpret the output of such CLI commands and integrate the results back into the workflow (e.g., using complexity report data).
*   **SHIP Document Support:**
    *   Utilizes the output from `task-master show <id>` (retrieved via Cursor AI or from HD's CLI execution) to help the HD accurately populate SHIP Section 5.3 (Planned Tasks) and Section 7 (Handoff Template).
*   **AI Mockup Generation Assistance:**
    *   Assists the HD in crafting effective prompts for AI Image Generation tools when UI mockups are needed, referencing the `B7.4_AI_Mockup_Prompt_Template.md` and relevant Bible sections.

## 7. Next Steps & Ongoing Refinement

This refined workflow, integrating Manus AI for detailed planning and Task Master for robust task management within the SHIP framework, represents a significant step towards a more structured and efficient development process for KarmaCash.

*   **Immediate Next Steps:**
    *   Continue utilizing this workflow for upcoming development sprints and milestones.
    *   Rigorously apply the defined templates for Manus AI output, JSON transformation, SHIP Handoffs, and SHIP Summaries.

## 9. Conclusion

The integration of Manus AI for detailed upfront planning and Claude Task Master for structured task tracking within the established SHIP methodology provides a more robust, transparent, and manageable development workflow for KarmaCash. By clearly defining roles for the HD and AI assistants (CK, Manus, CG), standardizing outputs through templates, and leveraging AI for transformations, this refined process aims to improve clarity in task definition, streamline session planning, facilitate the creation of UI mockups, and ensure consistent task tracking. While direct CLI interaction with Task Master by the HD remains essential for certain AI-driven operations due to current MCP tool limitations, the overall framework is designed for greater efficiency and a higher quality end-product. Continuous adaptation and refinement based on real-world application will be key to maximizing its benefits.

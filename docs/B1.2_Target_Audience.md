# Target Audience

KarmaCash is designed with specific user groups in mind, with a phased approach to audience expansion as the application develops from MVP to a more feature-rich platform.

## Primary Audience (MVP)

### Individual Users & Couples
- People looking for a simple yet powerful budgeting tool.
- Users who want more control and insight than banking apps offer.
- Individuals seeking to establish better financial habits.
- Couples managing shared finances informally (without requiring separate logins initially).

### Technical Comfort Level
- Users comfortable with technology and web applications.
- People who are willing to manually track transactions (rather than relying solely on bank connections).
- Users who prefer a "hands-on" approach to budget management.

### Language & Locale Support
- French-speaking users (specifically fr-CA locale).
- Users comfortable with currency displayed in CAD ($).

### Financial Management Style
- Zero-based budgeting practitioners ("give every dollar a job").
- Users interested in category-based spending analysis.
- People who want to track both regular and recurring financial commitments.
- Users who need flexible views of their finances (weekly/monthly perspectives).

### Financial Motivations
- Budget awareness and control.
- Spending pattern awareness.
- Reducing financial anxiety through better visibility.
- Establishing better financial habits.
- Achieving better month-to-month financial continuity.

## Secondary Audience (Post-MVP)

As KarmaCash evolves beyond the MVP phase, the target audience will expand to include:

### Household Groups
- Small families wanting to collaborate on a shared budget.
- Households with multiple contributing members.
- Roommates managing shared household expenses.
- Groups with mixed financial responsibilities.

### Financially-Focused Individuals
- Users seeking advanced features like savings goals and future projections.
- People looking to optimize their spending and saving habits.
- Users interested in more detailed financial analysis and reporting.
- Those wanting to reconcile budgets with actual bank transactions (e.g., via CSV import).

### Mindful Spenders
- Users attracted to the Zen/Tranquility approach to finances.
- People seeking to develop a more mindful relationship with money.
- Individuals who want financial tools that reduce stress rather than add to it.

## Audience Evolution Strategy

KarmaCash will focus initially on serving the Primary Audience effectively with the MVP, while designing the architecture to support the Secondary Audience needs in future iterations (specifically the **Shared Budgets** feature enabling Household Groups).

The evolution will follow this general pattern:
1. MVP (M1-M4 Features): Serve individual users and couples effectively.
2. First Expansion (High Priority Post-MVP): Add Shared Budgets functionality for households ([B1.4]). Implement Goal Setting and related Notifications.
3. Further Enhancements (Medium Priority Post-MVP): Introduce CSV Import/Reconciliation, advanced Reporting/Analytics.
4. Continued Refinement: Deepening the mindfulness aspects and exploring lower-priority features based on user feedback.

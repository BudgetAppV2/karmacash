# [B7.2] Session Handoff & Initialization Plan (SHIP) - Task Master Integrated Template

**Session:** M[Milestone#].S[Session#] - [Brief Session Focus]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

---
**(CK START BLOCK) Attention Context Keeper (CK):**

- **Your Role:** You are the CK for this KarmaCash session. Your primary function is to maintain context using this SHIP document and by referencing task details from our Task Master system via Cursor AI. Refer to Bible sections ([BX.Y]) for deeper detail when needed. Adhere to the AI Workflow defined in [B7.1].
- **HD Context:** Remember, the Human Developer (HD) is *not* a professional developer and relies heavily on your contextual support, planning assistance, and help interacting with Task Master via Cursor AI (CG).
- **Key Workflow Note:** We are using Task Master to manage detailed tasks. When preparing Handoffs (Section 7), you will assist the HD by prompting Cursor AI to `show task <ID>` from Task Master to retrieve the full details, description, and test strategy for the task being handed off.
- **Action Required:**
  1. Review this entire SHIP document thoroughly.
  2. Confirm understanding of your role, the HD's context, and the Task Master integration.
  3. Provide a concise summary of the **Plan for This Session (Section 5)**, including the **Goal (5.1)** and the **Planned Tasks (5.3)** which reference Task Master IDs.
---

**Purpose:** To structure our development session, maintain context, track Task Master tasks, and effectively collaborate with Cursor AI, following the workflow outlined in [B7.1].

## 1. Core Project Context (The Big Picture)

*Stable, foundational information. For full Bible structure, see [B0_README_TOC.md].*

- **Project Vision:** [Link to B1.0 or concise statement]
- **Guiding Principles:** [Link to B1.1 or list key principles]
- **Architecture Overview:** [Link to B2 or brief summary]
- **Key Standards:** [Link to B2.2 or list key standards]
- **Primary "Bible" Sections for this Milestone/Feature:** [e.g., B3.X, B5.Y, B6.Z]

## 2. Milestone & Project History (Where We Are Now)

*Tracks progress through the project roadmap ([B1.3]) and summarizes key past events.*

- **2.1. Project Roadmap (Task Master is Source of Truth for Task Details):**
  - `‚úÖ COMPLETED:` [List completed milestones/major features]
  - `‚ñ∂Ô∏è ACTIVE:` **M[#] - [Milestone Name]** (Current Overall Milestone)
  - `  FEATURE:` **[Feature Name Being Worked On, e.g., Enhance Navigation UX]** (Corresponds to Task Master Parent Task ID: #[TM_Parent_ID] if applicable)
  - `PENDING:` [Next few milestones/major features]
- **2.2. Current Milestone/Feature Status:** [Briefly describe where we are with the current ACTIVE feature/milestone, e.g., "Working on sub-tasks for defining navigation structure..."]
- **2.3. Recent Session Highlights (Last 1-3 Sessions):**
  - *(Example)* Session M[#].S[Prev#]: Completed TM#[ID] (Title), made decision X.
  - *(Add key decisions, achievements, TM tasks completed, blockers)*
- **2.4. Previous Milestone Outcomes & Key Historical Points:**
  - *(Summarize outcomes of recently completed major milestones/features)*

## 3. Our Collaboration Workflow (Ref: [B7.1])

- **HD Role:** Leads vision, makes decisions, validates, runs CLI TM commands if needed.
- **CK Role (You):** Context (SHIP + TM via Cursor), planning, Manus/Mockup prompt aid, Handoff prep from TM.
- **Cursor (CG) Role:** Implements Handoffs, provides summaries, TM queries.
- **Key Flow Element:** Task Master tasks drive detailed work. SHIP Sec 5.3 references TM tasks.

## 4. Previous Session Recap (Filled at End of *Last* Session)

*Summarizes the session that just finished.*

- **Achievements (inc. Task Master IDs completed):** `[...]`
- **Implementation Details (Key code/Bible changes):** `[...]`
- **Challenges & Solutions:** `[...]`
- **Visuals (Mockup refs, screenshots):** `[...]`

## 5. Plan for *This* Session: M[#].S[#] - [Brief Session Focus]

*Our focus and action plan for today.*

- **5.1. Session Goal:** `[Specific, measurable goal for THIS session]`
  - **Connects to Milestone/Feature:** `[How this helps achieve the ACTIVE feature/milestone from Sec 2.1/2.2]`
- **5.2. Primary Area(s) of Focus:** `[e.g., Specific React Components, Bible Document Section, UI Mockup Refinement]`

- **5.3. Planned Tasks for Today (Referencing Task Master):**
  *(Select 1-3 Task Master tasks/sub-tasks for this session. CK uses `task-master show <ID>` to get full details for Handoff prep.)*

  - **Task 1: (Ref: Task Master ID #[TM_ID]) - [Task Title from Task Master]**
    - **Session Objective:** `[Concise objective for THIS SESSION related to this TM task]`
    - **Key Bible Ref(s) (from TM task or context):** `[BX.Y]`
    - **Mockup/Files Reference (from TM task or context):** `[Path to mockup/file]`

  - **Task 2: (Ref: Task Master ID #[TM_ID]) - [Task Title from Task Master]**
    - **Session Objective:** `[...]`
    *   **Key Bible Ref(s):** `[...]`
    *   **Mockup/Files Reference:** `[...]`

  - *(Add Task 3 if applicable)*

- **5.4. Required Resources:**
    - Access to Task Master via Cursor AI (or HD via CLI for outputs).
    - Relevant mockups, Bible sections.
- **5.5. Expected Outcome:** `[What should be demonstrably working or completed by the end of THIS session? e.g., "TM#[ID] marked as done," "Draft of B3.X section completed."]`
- **5.6. Session Constraints:** `[Time limit, specific focus areas to exclude, etc.]`

- **5.0 Emergent Task Management (During the Session)**
  - *(Standard Emergent Task Log structure from [B7.1])*
  - **5.0.1 Emergent Task Log (CK Updates This):**
    - `[ ]`

- **5.7. Ideas for Next Session (M[#].S[Next#]):**
  *(Jot down thoughts, review Emergent Log. Identify next TM tasks.)*
  - **Potential Goal:** `[...]`
  - **Possible Task Master Task(s) for Next Session:** `[TM#[ID], TM#[ID]]`

## 6. Debugging Help

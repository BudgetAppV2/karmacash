# B2.5 Code & Project Structure

## Repository Organization

KarmaCash follows a modular, organized project structure that supports maintainability, scalability, and clear separation of concerns. The structure is designed to make navigation intuitive for developers and to facilitate the addition of new features.

### Root Directory Structure

## Source Code Organization (`src/`)

The `src/` directory contains the main React application code, organized primarily by feature and common concerns.

src/
├── app/ # Core App setup (Routing, Providers)
│ ├── App.jsx
│ ├── AppProviders.jsx
│ └── AppRoutes.jsx
├── assets/ # Static assets (images, etc.) - If needed
├── components/ # SHARED, Reusable, Presentational UI Components
│ ├── ui/ # Shared UI Primitives (e.g., Button, Card)
│ ├── calendar/ # <<< REVIEW NEEDED: Likely belongs in features/transactions
│ │ ├── DayCell.jsx
│ │ ├── DayCell.module.css
│ │ └── MonthlyCalendarView.module.css # Duplicate? Needs check.
│ ├── MonthlyCalendarView.jsx # <<< REVIEW NEEDED: Placement
│ └── MonthlyCalendarView.module.css # Duplicate? Needs check.
├── contexts/ # React Context Providers (AuthContext, ToastContext)

*(Note: Folders like `hooks`, `pages`, `types`, `styles` might exist or be needed later but weren't in the provided tree).*

## Component Organization Explained

- **Shared Components (`src/components/ui/`, potentially `core`/`layout`)**: Contain highly reusable UI components that are application-agnostic and purely presentational (e.g., `Button`, `Card`, `Modal`). *(Needs structure definition within `ui/` or top-level `components/`).*
- **Feature Components (`src/features/{featureName}/components/`)**: Components specific to a particular feature domain live within that feature's directory (e.g., `TransactionItem` belongs in `src/features/transactions/components/`). This promotes modularity.
- **Current Anomaly:** Calendar-related components (`MonthlyCalendarView`, `DayCell`) are currently under `src/components/`. **This should be reviewed**; they likely belong within `src/features/transactions/components/calendar/` or a dedicated feature folder as they relate directly to viewing transaction data. Potential duplicate files also noted.
- **Pages**: Top-level views/screens. Currently, page components like `TransactionsPage.jsx` exist within feature folders. **This co-location (Pages within Features) is the preferred approach.** The top-level `src/pages/` folder may not be needed.

## Cloud Functions Organization (`functions/`)

Firebase Cloud Functions source code resides in a separate `functions` directory at the project root.

functions/
├── utils/ # Shared logic within functions
│ └── logger.js # Functions-specific logger? Or shared w/ src/services? Needs check.
├── index.js # Main entry point exporting all functions
├── package.json # Functions dependencies
└── package-lock.json # Lock file

text
*(Note: The `logs/` directory is omitted as its purpose is unclear; function logs typically go to Cloud Logging. The previously proposed `/src` subdirectory within `functions/` does not currently exist but could be adopted later for better organization: `functions/src/{callable,triggers,...}`).*

## Styling Approach Standard

As defined in [B2.2 Technical Standards], the standard approach for component styling is **CSS Modules (`.module.css`)**.

- **Implementation:** Each *new* component should have a corresponding `.module.css` file (e.g., `ComponentName.jsx` uses `ComponentName.module.css`). Styles are imported and used via the `styles` object.
    ```
    import React from 'react';
    import styles from './ComponentName.module.css';

    export const ComponentName = (props) => {
      return <div className={styles.componentContainer}>...</div>;
    };
    ```
- **Scoping:** CSS Modules provide local scoping by default, preventing class name collisions.
- **Global Styles:** Use the `src/styles/` directory for truly global styles, resets, and CSS variable theme definitions ([B3.8]). Avoid broad, unscoped selectors in global files where possible.
- **Migration:** Existing components using inline styles or traditional CSS (prevalent in parts of the codebase) should be **gradually refactored** to use CSS Modules when they are significantly modified or during dedicated refactoring efforts. All *new* components **must** use CSS Modules.

## Conclusion

This project structure aims for clarity, maintainability, and scalability by organizing code based on features and shared concerns. Adhering to this structure (especially component location rules) and the defined CSS Modules standard ([B2.2]) is essential for consistent development within the AI-assisted workflow. Areas marked **"<<< REVIEW NEEDED"** should be addressed to ensure full alignment with the intended architecture.

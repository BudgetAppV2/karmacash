# B5.1 Schema Overview

## Introduction

This document provides a high-level overview of the data architecture for KarmaCash, focusing on the budget-centric structure (Phase 2) implemented from Milestone 4a onwards to support the critical Shared Budgets feature. This model replaces the initial user-centric structure (Phase 1) and includes planning for future invitation management.

## Core Architecture Principles

The data model follows these key principles:

1. **Budget-Centric Organization (Phase 2)**: Data is primarily organized under top-level budgets documents, enabling collaborative access and management via a clear membership model.
2. **Clear Membership & Permissions**: Explicit roles (owner, editor, viewer) stored within the budget's members map control user actions, enforced by security rules.
3. **Efficient User-Budget Linking**: A denormalized `/users/{userId}/budgetMemberships` subcollection provides efficient lookup of budgets a user belongs to.
4. **Consistent Date Handling**: All date/time values are stored as UTC Timestamps ([B2.3]).
5. **Clear Relationships & User Attribution**: Explicit references (budgetId, categoryId, createdByUserId) link related data and track user actions.
6. **Optimized Access Patterns**: Structure supports common queries (especially fetching data for a single budget) and security rules efficiently.
7. **Planned Invitation System**: Includes a structure for managing budget invitations, although full implementation is deferred.

## Schema Evolution Status

KarmaCash has transitioned through two architectural phases:

### Phase 1: MVP Structure (Milestones 1-3 - DEPRECATED)

Data was organized user-centrically (`/users/{userId}/...`). This structure is no longer used.

### Phase 2: Shared Budgets Structure (M4a onwards - CURRENT)

The schema transitioned to a budget-centric model:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph User Space
        U(User /users/{userId});
        BM(BudgetMemberships .../budgetMemberships/{budgetId});
        U -- has many --> BM;
    end

    subgraph Budget Space
        B(Budget /budgets/{budgetId});
        CAT(Categories .../categories/{catId});
        RR(RecurringRules .../recurringRules/{ruleId});
        T(Transactions .../transactions/{txId});
        MD(MonthlyData .../monthlyData/{yyyy-mm});

        B -- owns many --> CAT;
        B -- owns many --> RR;
        B -- owns many --> T;
        B -- owns many --> MD;
    end

    subgraph Invitation Space
        INV(BudgetInvitations /budgetInvitations/{invitationId});
    end

    subgraph Relationships
        BM -- references --> B;
        RR -- references one --> CAT;
        RR -- generates many --> T;
        T -- belongs to one --> CAT;
        T -- tracks creating/editing user --> U; # (via userId fields)
        MD -- allocations reference --> CAT;
        MD -- calculations based on --> T;
        B -- contains members list referencing --> U; # (via members map)
        INV -- relates to --> B;
        INV -- relates to --> U; # (Inviter/Invitee)
    end

    style B fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style U fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style INV fill:#ffc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
```

This budget-centric structure is the foundation for shared budgets ([B1.4]) and all development from Milestone 4 onwards.

## Collection Purposes (Phase 2 Structure)

### `/budgets` Collection
- **Path**: `/budgets/{budgetId}`
- **Purpose**: Top-level container for each budget. Stores metadata (name, owner, currency), settings, schema version, and the crucial members map defining access roles. Parent for budget-specific subcollections.

### `.../categories` Subcollection
- **Path**: `/budgets/{budgetId}/categories/{categoryId}`
- **Purpose**: Defines income/expense categories specific to this budget. Managed by owners/editors.

### `.../recurringRules` Subcollection
- **Path**: `/budgets/{budgetId}/recurringRules/{ruleId}`
- **Purpose**: Defines recurring transaction rules specific to this budget. Links to categories within the same budget. Managed by owners/editors.

### `.../transactions` Subcollection
- **Path**: `/budgets/{budgetId}/transactions/{transactionId}`
- **Purpose**: Records all income/expense transactions belonging to this budget. Includes createdByUserId/lastEditedByUserId. Accessible based on budget membership.

### `.../monthlyData` Subcollection
- **Path**: `/budgets/{budgetId}/monthlyData/{yyyy-mm}`
- **Purpose**: Stores monthly allocations and calculated summaries ([B6.1]) for the specific budget and month. Managed by owners/editors. Document ID is YYYY-MM.

### `/users` Collection
- **Path**: `/users/{userId}`
- **Purpose**: Stores user profile information and application-wide preferences.

### `/users/{userId}/budgetMemberships` Subcollection
- **Path**: `/users/{userId}/budgetMemberships/{budgetId}`
- **Purpose**: Denormalized link allowing efficient lookup of budgets a user belongs to and their role in each. Document ID matches the budgetId.

### `/budgetInvitations` Collection (Deferred Implementation)
- **Path**: `/budgetInvitations/{invitationId}`
- **Purpose**: Stores pending invitations for users to join budgets. Tracks status and necessary data for the invitation process.
- **Note**: While the schema is defined here for architectural completeness, the implementation of invitation UI, logic, notifications, and associated Cloud Functions is planned for a later phase (likely Post-MVP).

## Membership & Permissions Model

Permissions are managed via the members map in each `/budgets/{budgetId}` document:

```javascript
// Example /budgets/{budgetId}.members field
members: {
  "user123abc": { // User ID is the key
    role: "owner",     // "owner", "editor", or "viewer"
    displayName: "Jean Dupont", // Denormalized for UI
    email: "jean.dupont@example.com", // Denormalized for UI/Invites
    joinedAt: Timestamp // Audit field
  },
  "user456def": {
    role: "editor",
    displayName: "Marie Martin",
    email: "marie.martin@example.com",
    joinedAt: Timestamp
  }
}
```

Roles (owner, editor, viewer) dictate actions allowed, enforced by Firestore Security Rules. Each budget must have exactly one owner.

## Document ID Strategies

- **users**: Firebase Authentication UID.
- **budgets**: Auto-generated Firestore IDs.
- **categories, recurringRules, transactions, budgetInvitations**: Auto-generated Firestore IDs.
- **monthlyData**: String YYYY-MM.
- **budgetMemberships**: Matches the budgetId it references.

## Denormalization Strategy

Strategic denormalization optimizes access:

- **members Map in Budget**: Includes role, display name, email, joined date. Improves member list UI performance. Requires sync logic if user profile changes (or accept potential staleness).
- **budgetMemberships Subcollection**: Duplicates budget name, role, owner, currency for efficient "My Budgets" listing. Requires atomic updates (batch writes/functions) when membership changes.
- **createdByUserId/lastEditedByUserId in Subcollections**: Tracks user actions.
- **budgetId in Subcollections**: Included for potential collection group queries.
- **Calculated Fields in monthlyData**: Pre-calculate sums ([B6.1]).
- **budgetName, inviterName etc. in budgetInvitations**: Denormalized for displaying invitation details efficiently.

## UTC Date Handling

All date fields follow the standard defined in [B2.3 Date Handling Guide].

## Migration Considerations (Phase 1 -> Phase 2)

Decision: As current data is test data, no migration script is required. Old user-centric collections will be deleted. Users start fresh in the new structure.

## Schema Validation

Validation occurs via Frontend, Services, Cloud Functions, and Firestore Security Rules (Strategy outlined in [B5.2]).

## Scalability Considerations

- Top-level budgets collection supports Firestore sharding.
- Subcollections handle potentially large lists (transactions).
- members map suitable for typical household sizes; budgetMemberships aids user-centric queries.
- Indexing strategy outlined in [B5.2].

Detailed schemas are in [B5.2 Collections & Schemas].

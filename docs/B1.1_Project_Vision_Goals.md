# Project Vision & Goals

## Vision Statement

KarmaCash aims to create a clean, intuitive, and reliable personal budgeting web application that helps users gain complete control over their finances through accurate tracking, insightful visualization, and effective budget planning. The application embraces a "Zen/Tranquility" aesthetic to transform the typically stressful experience of financial management into one of mindfulness, clarity, and positive control.

Built with modern web technologies and best practices, KarmaCash is designed to evolve from a personal tool to a potential commercial product that can serve a wider audience, with a foundation designed for scalability and future feature expansion.

## Core Principles

- **Calm Financial Experience**: Financial management should not create anxiety. KarmaCash uses a Zen/Tranquility theme with muted natural colors, generous whitespace, and minimalist design to create a supportive sanctuary rather than another source of pressure.

- **Clarity & Transparency**: All financial calculations (especially rollover, available funds, and category spending) are 100% accurate and transparent to users, building trust through reliability.

- **Mindful Financial Management**: The design encourages users to slow down and be presentâ€”principles directly applicable to healthier financial decision-making, aligning with the "KarmaCash" name that evokes the concept that today's financial actions have future consequences.

- **Progressive Functionality**: The application starts with core personal budgeting features, with a clear path to expand into shared budgets, goals, and more sophisticated financial management.

## Primary Goals

### 1. Clean Architecture & Codebase
- Develop a well-structured, maintainable codebase using modern web technologies and best practices.
- Create modular components that facilitate future expansion.
- Implement proper separation of concerns across the application.
- Prioritize code quality and documentation for long-term maintainability.

### 2. Enhanced User Experience
- Create an intuitive interface using the Zen/Tranquility design principles.
- Make budget management simple and accessible through clear, focused interfaces.
- Pay particular attention to efficient transaction entry and meaningful visualization.
- Reduce cognitive load through generous whitespace and progressive disclosure of complexity.

### 3. Financial Accuracy
- Ensure all budget calculations are mathematically precise and reliable.
- Implement correct rollover logic between budget periods.
- Provide transparent category spending tracking with clear visual indicators.
- Maintain data consistency across all views and calculations.

### 4. Data Integrity & Persistence
- Implement a robust database structure using Firebase Firestore (evolving for shared budgets - see [B5.2]).
- Ensure user data is securely stored and protected through proper authentication and security rules.
- Design for reliable data access across devices.
- Follow strict UTC date handling standards for consistency across timezones (see [B2.3]).

### 5. Commercial Potential
- Design the application with scalability in mind.
- Establish a foundation that can eventually support a freemium model with premium features.
- Create a structure that will accommodate shared budgets and other monetizable features.
- Build with expansion to a wider user base in mind.

## Project Background

The original personal budgeting web application was built using AI tools (Claude, Cursor AI) and deployed to Firebase, using Google Sheets as a database. However, over time, the local/modified codebase became unmanageable, and crucially, access to the source code of the working deployed version on Firebase became unavailable.

Rather than attempting to debug the modified code or retrieve the deployed version, the decision was made to rebuild the application from scratch with a cleaner foundation, incorporating lessons learned from the initial implementation and using a more sustainable development approach documented in this Bible.

## MVP Scope Definition

The functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for KarmaCash, providing core value and initial launch capability, encompasses the features planned through Milestones 1-4 as outlined in the Roadmap ([B1.3]). This includes:

- Secure user authentication (signup, login, session persistence) [M1]
- Custom income/expense category management [M2]
- Efficient transaction entry and management [M2]
- Recurring transaction rule definition and instance generation (via Callable Function) [M3]
- Enhanced weekly and monthly (calendar) transaction viewing with filtering [M3]
- Clear graphical summaries (e.g., income vs. expense) [M2/M4 - details TBD]
- Core monthly zero-based budgeting features: [M4]
  - Accurate Available Funds calculation
  - Category allocation controls
  - Basic spending tracking visuals
  - Correct positive/negative rollover between months

Post-MVP features, starting with Shared Budgets, are defined in [B1.4].

# B3.4 UI/UX Guidelines - Zen/Tranquility Theme

These guidelines define the core UI/UX principles for KarmaCash, emphasizing the Zen/Tranquility theme that creates a calm, focused, and mindful user experience.

## Core Principles

### Calm & Minimalist Aesthetic
- Create a serene, uncluttered interface that reduces financial anxiety.
- Use muted, natural colors from the Japandi-inspired palette defined in [B3.8] / [B3.9].
- Incorporate generous whitespace and clean typography ([B3.8]).
- Avoid visual noise or excessive elements that could create stress when dealing with financial information.

### Clarity & Focus
- Prioritize information hierarchy to guide users' attention to what matters most.
- Use subtle visual cues rather than harsh contrasting elements ([B3.8]).
- Each screen should have a clear purpose with minimal distractions.
- Support mindful financial decision-making through focused interface design.

### Responsive Design
- Ensure the application works seamlessly across devices (mobile to desktop).
- Maintain the calm aesthetic across all viewport sizes.
- Use responsive techniques (flexbox, grid, media queries).
- Pay special attention to comfortable spacing on all screen sizes as defined in [B3.8].

### Component-Based Architecture
- Build the UI using reusable shared components ([B3.7], `src/components/...`) and feature-specific components ([B2.5], `src/features/...`) that follow the styling principles in [B3.8].
- Maintain consistency in component behavior, styling, and animation across the application.
- Create a component library structure that reflects the Zen/Tranquility principles ([B3.7]).

### Consistent Navigation
- Implement intuitive, predictable navigation with gentle transitions between sections ([B3.11]).
- Keep tab-based main navigation ('Transactions', 'Budget', 'Graphiques', etc.) and date controls consistently placed and styled.
- Ensure users always understand where they are within the application.

### Data Visualization Clarity
- Charts and graphs should convey financial information clearly without creating anxiety.
- Use the softer, harmonious color scheme defined in the Style Guide [B3.8].
- Ensure adequate spacing between elements.
- Implement the subtle animations defined in [B3.11].

### Gentle Interactive Feedback
- Provide calm, reassuring feedback for user actions.
- Use the micro-interactions defined in [B3.11] for form validation, button states, and loading indicators.
- Toast notifications ([Ref needed - maybe B3.7 Component Spec?]) should appear and disappear with subtle animations.
- Use appropriate semantic colors from [B3.8].

### Language & Localization
- Maintain French UI text as defined in [B3.6], with 'fr-CA' locale for date/currency formatting.
- Ensure typography follows the guidelines in [B3.8] for optimal readability of French text.
- Currency symbol remains '$' (CAD).
- Follow the UTC date/time handling standards defined in [B2.3].

### Accessibility & Inclusion
- Create an interface accessible to all users (Target WCAG 2.1 AA [B2.2]).
- Ensure sufficient color contrast while maintaining the muted palette ([B3.8]).
- Make interactive elements clearly identifiable through subtle yet effective visual cues.
- Support keyboard navigation and screen readers.

### Touch-Friendly Interactions
- Design for comfortable touch interaction with appropriately sized targets (minimum 44x44px as per [B3.8]).
- Implement refined touch gestures like swipe-to-delete for transactions with the subtle animations defined in [B3.11].
- Ensure adequate spacing between interactive elements on touch devices.

### Progressive Disclosure
- Reveal complexity gradually, showing essential information first.
- Allow users to access details as needed.
- Support the Zen principle of maintaining calm while dealing with potentially complex financial data.
- Use expandable/collapsible sections (e.g., weekly transaction cards) for detailed information.

### Supportive Empty States
- Create thoughtful empty states that guide users with gentle encouragement.
- Use supportive language ([B3.6]) and subtle visual cues to help users get started.
- Avoid stark emptiness that could create uncertainty.

### Soothing Error Handling
- Present errors calmly using the Negative accent color (Soft Terra Cotta) from [B3.8].
- Avoid alarming experiences even when communicating problems.
- Provide clear, actionable guidance for resolution.
- Follow the Error Handling Strategy defined in [B2.4].

## Implementation Guidance

When implementing the KarmaCash UI/UX, developers should:

1.  **Refer to the Style Guide**: Always reference [B3.8] for specific color values (Palette v5 TBC), spacing, typography, and component styling.
2.  **Use Animation Guidelines**: Follow [B3.11] for timing, easing, and animation principles.
3.  **Follow Component Specs**: Implement components according to [B3.7] specifications.
4.  **Maintain Language Consistency**: Use the French terminology defined in [B3.6].
5.  **Test Across Devices**: Ensure the calm, focused experience translates to all viewport sizes (Mobile-First [B2.2]).
6.  **Preserve Whitespace**: Resist the urge to fill space; generous whitespace is essential to the Zen aesthetic [B3.8].
7.  **Prioritize Clarity**: When in doubt, choose the clearer, more focused solution over the more feature-rich one.
8.  **Consider Emotional Impact**: Evaluate each design decision for its effect on the user's sense of calm and control [B2.1].

By adhering to these guidelines, KarmaCash will provide a uniquely tranquil approach to financial management, differentiating it from conventional finance applications and better serving users seeking a more mindful relationship with their finances.

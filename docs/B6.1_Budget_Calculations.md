# B6.1 Budget Calculations

This document defines the exact formulas and logic for critical financial calculations within KarmaCash, ensuring consistency and accuracy across the application.

## 1. Overview

All budget calculations conform to these principles:

1. **Zero-based budgeting** methodology is used (every dollar has a purpose).
2. **Monthly timeframe** is the primary budgeting period.
3. **Rollover handling** correctly manages both positive and negative balances between months.
4. **Category-level calculations** provide detailed spending insights.
5. All calculations operate on numerical data fetched from Firestore.

## 2. Monthly Budget Calculation Flow

The budget calculation flow follows this sequence:

1. Calculate monthly revenue and recurring expenses.
2. Determine rollover from previous month (if any).
3. Calculate available funds based on income, expenses, and rollover.
4. Track user-specified allocations for each category.
5. Determine remaining-to-allocate amount.
6. Calculate actual spending per category.
7. Determine monthly savings.

## 3. Key Calculations

### 3.1 Monthly Revenue Calculation

**Purpose**: Calculate total income for the month.

**Formula**:
```
MonthlyRevenue = Sum of all transactions where:
  type is "income"
  date falls within the specified month
```

**Implementation Notes**:
- Includes both recurring and non-recurring income.
- Uses transaction date (`date` field), not creation date.
- Operates on transaction amounts (assuming positive values for income).

**Storage**: Stored in budget document as `calculated.revenue` ([B5.2]).

### 3.2 Monthly Recurring Expenses Calculation

**Purpose**: Calculate total recurring expenses deducted *before* allocation availability.

**Formula**:
```
MonthlyRecurringExpenses = Sum of all transactions where:
  type is "expense"
  isRecurringInstance is true
  date falls within the specified month
```

**Implementation Notes**:
- Only includes transactions flagged as recurring instances.
- Uses transaction date (`date` field).
- Operates on transaction amounts (assuming positive values, `type` denotes expense).

**Storage**: Stored in budget document as `calculated.recurringExpenses` ([B5.2]).

### 3.3 Monthly Budget Rollover Calculation

**Purpose**: Determine how much unallocated or overspent money carries over from the previous month.

**Formula**:
```
If previous month's budget document exists:
  RolloverAmount = PreviousMonthBudget.calculated.availableToAllocate - PreviousMonthBudget.calculated.totalAllocated
Else:
  RolloverAmount = 0
```

**Implementation Notes**:
- Positive rollover indicates unspent funds carried forward from the previous month.
- Negative rollover indicates overspending/over-allocation carried forward from the previous month.
- January has no rollover unless the previous December's budget document exists.
- The rollover amount directly impacts the next month's `availableToAllocate`.

**Storage**: Stored in budget document as `calculated.rolloverFromPrevious` ([B5.2]).

### 3.4 Monthly Available Funds Calculation

**Purpose**: Calculate the total funds available for allocation in the current month. This is the starting point for manual budgeting.

**Formula**:
```
AvailableFunds = MonthlyRevenue - MonthlyRecurringExpenses + RolloverAmount
```

**Implementation Notes**:
- This is the key figure for the zero-based budgeting allocation process.
- Can be negative if there's a large negative rollover.
- Represents the amount a user can distribute across their spending categories.

**Storage**: Stored in budget document as `calculated.availableToAllocate` ([B5.2]).

### 3.5 Monthly Total Allocated Calculation

**Purpose**: Calculate the sum of all user-defined budget allocations across categories.

**Formula**:
```
TotalAllocated = Sum of all values in the budgetDocument.allocations map
```

**Implementation Notes**:
- Derived directly from user-provided allocation values.
- Updated when user modifies any category allocation.
- Compared to `availableToAllocate` to achieve a zero-based balance.

**Storage**: Stored in budget document as `calculated.totalAllocated` ([B5.2]).

### 3.6 Monthly Remaining to Allocate Calculation

**Purpose**: Determine how much of the `AvailableFunds` still need to be allocated.

**Formula**:
```
RemainingToAllocate = AvailableFunds - TotalAllocated
```

**Implementation Notes**:
- Zero indicates a perfectly balanced zero-based budget.
- Positive indicates funds are available but not yet assigned to a category.
- Negative indicates the user has allocated more money than is available.
- Updates dynamically in the UI as allocations change.

**Storage**: Stored in budget document as `calculated.remainingToAllocate` ([B5.2]).

### 3.7 Monthly Actual Spending per Category Calculation

**Purpose**: Calculate net actual spending in each category, accounting for income offsets (e.g., reimbursements).

**Formula**:
```
For each category:
  CategoryExpenses = Sum of all transactions where:
    - categoryId matches the category
    - type is "expense"
    - date falls within the specified month
  CategoryIncome = Sum of all transactions where:
    - categoryId matches the category
    - type is "income"
    - date falls within the specified month
  NetCategorySpending = CategoryExpenses - CategoryIncome
  *(Assumes transaction amounts are stored as positive values and `type` dictates sign)*
```

**Implementation Notes**:
- A negative `NetCategorySpending` value indicates net income in that category for the month.
- Crucial for categories like "Sant√©" (Health) where reimbursements offset expenses.
- This value is typically calculated **on-demand in the UI or frontend logic** for display against allocations, not usually stored persistently in the main budget doc unless needed for performance optimization.

**Storage**: Calculated dynamically; **NOT** typically stored in the main budget document's `calculated` map. Displayed per category in UI.

### 3.8 Monthly Total Spent Calculation

**Purpose**: Calculate the total outflow (spending) for the month.

**Formula**:
```
// Uses transactions directly (preferred method for accuracy)
TotalSpent = Sum of transaction.amount for all transactions where:
  type is "expense"
  date falls within the specified month
*(Assumes transaction amounts are stored as positive values)*
```

**Implementation Notes**:
- Includes both recurring and non-recurring expenses.
- Updates as new transactions are added/modified.
- Net income in categories (from 3.7) does not reduce this total spending figure; this represents gross outflow.

**Storage**: Stored in budget document as `calculated.totalSpent` ([B5.2]).

### 3.9 Monthly Savings Calculation

**Purpose**: Calculate the net difference between income and spending for the month.

**Formula**:
```
MonthlySavings = MonthlyRevenue - TotalSpent
```

**Implementation Notes**:
- Positive value indicates net savings for the month.
- Negative value indicates spending exceeded income for the month.
- Distinct from Rollover; indicates monthly performance, while Rollover links budgets month-to-month.

**Storage**: Stored in budget document as `calculated.monthlySavings` ([B5.2]).

## 4. Special Cases

### 4.1 First Month Handling
- RolloverAmount = 0.
- AvailableFunds = MonthlyRevenue - MonthlyRecurringExpenses.

### 4.2 Negative Available Funds
- Occurs with large negative RolloverAmount.
- UI must clearly indicate this. User still allocates; RemainingToAllocate will show a larger negative value.

### 4.3 Income in Expense Categories
- Handled correctly by `NetCategorySpending` calculation (3.7). Reduces spending *within that category* but does *not* affect `TotalSpent` (3.8).

## 5. User Interface Calculations

Beyond core budget doc fields:

### 5.1 Category Budget Progress
- `ProgressPercentage = (NetCategorySpending / CategoryAllocation) * 100`
- UI displays percentage (often capped at 100%), visual bar, over/under status.

### 5.2 Header Balance Calculation
- **Period Mode**: `Sum(Income in Period) - Sum(Expense in Period)`
- **Cumulative Mode**: `Sum(All Income <= Period End) - Sum(All Expense <= Period End)`
- Requires separate queries based on mode selection.

## 6. Recalculation Triggers

Calculations relying on transaction data (Revenue, Recurring Expenses, Spending) or allocations need updating when:
- Viewing Budget section for a month.
- Allocations are modified by the user.
- Transactions within the relevant period are added, edited, or deleted.
- A new month rolls over (for rollover calculation).
*(Strategy: Server-side recalculation via Callable Function [B4.3]? Triggered by client? Recalculate entirely on client? Decision needed)*

## 7. Implementation in Firestore

- **Read Data**: Fetch relevant transactions (based on date range/type/recurring status), previous month's budget doc (`calculated` fields for rollover).
- **Store Results**: Persist calculated fields (`revenue`, `recurringExpenses`, `rolloverFromPrevious`, `availableToAllocate`, `totalAllocated`, `remainingToAllocate`, `totalSpent`, `monthlySavings`) within the `/users/{userId}/budgets/{yyyy-mm}` document ([B5.2]) or the Phase 2 equivalent. `NetCategorySpending` is typically calculated client-side.

## 8. Code Example *(Conceptual)*

*(Code examples illustrating calculation logic omitted for brevity - implementation resides in services/hooks or potentially Cloud Function [B4.3])*

## 9. Validation Rules

- Ensure calculations handle division by zero (e.g., ProgressPercentage if allocation is 0).
- Use number types consistently; handle potential `NaN` results.
- Validate inputs (e.g., allocations non-negative).
- Adhere strictly to UTC Date Handling standards [B2.3] for range queries.

## 10. Testing Strategy

Test scenarios outlined in [B7.2] must cover:
- Normal month, First month, Negative rollover month.
- Zero income/expense scenarios.
- Category reimbursements.
- Over/under allocation.
- Month boundary edge cases (transaction on 1st/last day).

## 11. Performance Considerations

- Minimize number of reads/queries needed for calculation (e.g., store/cache rollover).
- Consider server-side calculation ([B4.3]) if client-side becomes too slow with large transaction volumes.
- Ensure necessary Firestore indexes exist for date/type/recurring queries ([B5.2]).

## Conclusion

These calculations define the core zero-based budgeting logic for KarmaCash. Accurate and consistent implementation is paramount for user trust and application utility. These formulas will be implemented primarily during Milestone 4b, referencing data stored according to the schemas defined in [B5.2].

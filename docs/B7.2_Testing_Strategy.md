# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing approach for KarmaCash, defining methodologies, priorities, and processes to ensure application quality and reliability.

## 1. Overview

For KarmaCash MVP development, testing will follow a pragmatic approach that balances thoroughness with development velocity. The primary testing methodology will be manual testing performed by the developer, supported by console logging and direct inspection of Firestore data.

## 2. Testing Principles

The KarmaCash testing strategy adheres to these core principles:

1. **User-Centric**: Testing prioritizes real user flows and experiences
2. **Functionality First**: Core financial functionality must be thoroughly verified
3. **Data Integrity**: Financial data accuracy is non-negotiable
4. **Practical Approach**: Testing methods match team size and development pace
5. **Progressive Refinement**: Testing evolves as the application matures

## 3. Testing Methods

### 3.1 Manual UI Testing

Manual testing will be the primary quality assurance method during MVP development:

- **User Flow Testing**: Following complete user journeys through the application
- **Visual Inspection**: Ensuring UI elements render correctly across viewports
- **Edge Case Exploration**: Testing boundary conditions and unusual inputs
- **Cross-Device Testing**: Verifying responsive behavior on different devices

### 3.2 Console Logging & Inspection

Strategic logging will support debugging and verification:

- **State Logging**: Verify component state changes and data flow
- **API Response Logs**: Confirm correct data exchange with Firebase
- **Performance Markers**: Track execution time of critical operations
- **Error Capture**: Detailed logging of exceptions and error conditions

### 3.3 Firestore Data Verification

Direct inspection of Firestore data will validate backend operations:

- **Document Structure**: Verify data is saved with correct schema
- **Relationship Integrity**: Confirm proper references between documents
- **Calculation Accuracy**: Validate calculated fields match expected values
- **Transaction Consistency**: Ensure batch operations complete successfully

### 3.4 AI-Assisted Code Review

Code review with AI assistance will help identify potential issues:

- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying common bugs and anti-patterns
- **Standard Compliance**: Verifying adherence to project standards
- **Edge Case Identification**: Suggesting scenarios for testing
- **Logic Validation**: Checking calculation and business logic

## 4. Testing Focus Areas

### 4.1 Financial Calculation Accuracy

Financial calculations must be rigorously verified:

- **Budget Allocations**: Verify allocation math and constraints
- **Balance Calculations**: Test both periodic and cumulative balance calculations
- **Rollover Logic**: Ensure correct handling of month-to-month rollovers (both positive and negative)
- **Category Spending**: Validate category total calculations, especially with income offsets

### 4.2 Data Persistence & Integrity

Data storage and retrieval must be reliable:

- **CRUD Operations**: Confirm create, read, update, and delete operations work correctly
- **Error Recovery**: Test behavior when operations fail (network issues, permissions)
- **State Synchronization**: Verify UI stays in sync with backend data
- **Concurrent Modifications**: Test for potential race conditions

### 4.3 Authentication & Security

User identity and data security must be robust:

- **Authentication Flows**: Verify signup, login, logout processes
- **Session Handling**: Test session persistence and recovery
- **Security Rules**: Validate Firestore security rules prevent unauthorized access
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure user data is properly isolated

### 4.4 User Interface & Experience

The interface must support the Zen/Tranquility theme goals:

- **Visual Consistency**: Verify styling matches the design system
- **Responsive Behavior**: Test layouts across device sizes
- **Interaction Patterns**: Validate micro-interactions and animations
- **Accessibility**: Check basic accessibility features

## 5. Milestone-Specific Testing Strategies

Each development milestone has specific testing priorities:

## 6. Test Data Management

### 6.1 Test Data Generation

A test data script will be developed to populate Firestore with consistent test data:

```javascript
// Example test data generation script (simplified)
async function generateTestData(userId) {
  const db = firebase.firestore();
  const batch = db.batch();
  
  // Create test categories
  const categories = [
    { id: 'cat_1', name: 'Groceries', type: 'expense' },
    { id: 'cat_2', name: 'Rent', type: 'expense' },
    { id: 'cat_3', name: 'Salary', type: 'income' }
    // ... more categories
  ];
  
  // Add categories to Firestore
  categories.forEach(category => {
    const categoryRef = db.collection('users').doc(userId)
      .collection('categories').doc(category.id);
    batch.set(categoryRef, {
      ...category,
      userId,
      isDefault: true,
      createdAt: firebase.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp()
    });
  });
  
  // Create test transactions
  const transactions = [
    { 
      categoryId: 'cat_1', 
      date: new Date(2023, 0, 15), 
      type: 'expense',
      amount: 75.50,
      description: 'Weekly groceries'
    },
    // ... more transactions
  ];
  
  // Add transactions to Firestore
  transactions.forEach(transaction => {
    const transactionRef = db.collection('users').doc(userId)
      .collection('transactions').doc();
    batch.set(transactionRef, {
      ...transaction,
      userId,
      isRecurringInstance: false,
      createdAt: firebase.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
      updatedAt: firebase.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp()
    });
  });
  
  // Create test budget data
  // ... budget data creation
  
  // Commit all test data
  await batch.commit();
  console.log('Test data generated successfully');
}
```

### 6.2 Test Data Scenarios

The test data will include specific scenarios:

- **Month with positive savings**: For testing positive rollover
- **Month with overspending**: For testing negative rollover
- **Category with reimbursements**: For testing income in expense categories
- **Complex recurring rules**: For testing recurring transaction generation
- **Budget with full and partial allocations**: For testing budget calculations

### 6.3 Test Data Isolation

To prevent test data from affecting production:

- Test using the Firebase Emulator Suite when possible
- Use separate test user accounts for testing
- Clear test data after testing is complete
- Avoid using production users for testing

## 7. Testing Workflow

### 7.1 Feature Development Testing Flow

When developing new features:

1. **Pre-Implementation Testing**: Review requirements and identify test cases
2. **Implementation Testing**: Test functionality as it's developed
3. **Integration Testing**: Verify integration with existing features
4. **Final Verification**: Comprehensive testing of the complete feature

### 7.2 Bug Fix Testing Flow

When addressing bugs:

1. **Reproduction Testing**: Verify the bug can be consistently reproduced
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify the underlying issue
3. **Fix Verification**: Test that the fix resolves the issue
4. **Regression Testing**: Verify that the fix doesn't break other functionality

### 7.3 Documentation

Test results should be documented:

- Log significant issues found during testing
- Document workarounds for known issues
- Track fixed issues to prevent regression

## 8. Error Handling Testing

### 8.1 Expected Error Scenarios

Test handling of expected error conditions:

- **Network failures**: Test offline behavior and reconnection

# B4.2 Frontend Structure

This document details the organization, high-level architecture, and key patterns of the KarmaCash frontend application, built with React. Refer to [B2.5 Code & Project Structure] for the detailed file tree and [B2.2 Technical Standards] for specific implementation rules.

## 1. Application Architecture

KarmaCash employs a component-based architecture focused on separation of concerns, reusability, and maintainability.

### 1.1 Architectural Pattern
The primary flow involves UI Components interacting with business logic encapsulated in Hooks and Services, which in turn communicate with the Firebase backend. Global state is managed via React Context.

### 1.2 State Management Approach
A hybrid approach is used, prioritizing local state and lifting state only when necessary:
1.  **Component State**: `useState` for UI state internal to a component.
2.  **Shared Global State**: React `useContext` for application-wide state like authentication (`AuthContext`) and notifications (`ToastContext`).
3.  **Server Cache/Remote State**: Custom Hooks (`src/hooks/`) encapsulating Firestore listeners (`onSnapshot`) or data fetching logic to manage data synchronization, loading, and error states related to backend data.
4.  **URL State**: `react-router-dom` used for state reflected in the URL (e.g., current page, selected transaction ID potentially).

## 2. Core `src/` Directory Structure

The application source code is organized as follows (Refer to [B2.5] for full details):

-   **`src/app/`**: Core application setup, including top-level providers (`AppProviders.jsx`) and routing configuration (`AppRoutes.jsx`).
-   **`src/components/`**: Contains only **shared, reusable, presentational UI components** agnostic of specific features. Organized into subdirectories like `core/` (e.g., Button, Card) and `layout/` (e.g., PageWrapper, HeaderShell).
-   **`src/contexts/`**: Houses all React Context providers for managing global state (e.g., `AuthContext.jsx`, `ToastContext.jsx`).
-   **`src/features/`**: **The primary location for application modules.** Each subdirectory represents a distinct feature domain (e.g., `auth`, `transactions`, `budget`, `categories`).
    -   **`src/features/{featureName}/components/`**: Contains UI components **specific** to that feature (e.g., `src/features/transactions/components/TransactionItem.jsx`).
    -   **`src/features/{featureName}/{FeaturePage.jsx}`**: Feature-specific pages/screens often reside directly within the feature folder.
-   **`src/hooks/`**: Contains custom reusable React Hooks encapsulating complex stateful logic or side effects (e.g., `useFirestoreQuery`, `useReducedMotion`).
-   **`src/services/`**: Handles interactions with external services, primarily Firebase. Contains subdirectories like `firebase/` (housing specific service files like `auth.js`, `transactions.js`, `categories.js`) and potentially `logger.js`.
-   **`src/styles/`**: Contains global CSS files, including resets (`reset.css`), theme variables (`theme.css`), and base styles (`index.css`). Component-specific styles use **CSS Modules** ([B2.2], [B2.5]).
-   **`src/utils/`**: Holds pure utility functions, organized by concern (e.g., `formatters.js`, `dateUtils.js`, calculation helpers).
-   **`src/main.jsx`**: The main application entry point where React is rendered into the DOM.

## 3. Key Implementation Patterns

-   **Component Structure**: Functional components with Hooks are standard ([B2.2]). JSDoc is used for documenting props and purpose.
-   **Styling**: CSS Modules (`.module.css`) provide locally scoped styles for components. Global styles and theme variables reside in `src/styles/` ([B2.2], [B2.5]).
-   **Firebase Interaction**: Abstracted into dedicated service functions within `src/services/firebase/`. Components interact with these services, often via custom hooks.
-   **Routing**: Handled declaratively using `react-router-dom` configured in `src/app/AppRoutes.jsx`, with protected routes for authenticated sections.

## 4. Conclusion

This frontend structure promotes modularity and separation of concerns, facilitating development and maintenance within the AI-assisted workflow. Key standards include the feature-based directory organization, clear separation of shared vs. feature components, the use of React Hooks and Context for state, a dedicated service layer for backend interactions, and CSS Modules for styling. Adherence to this structure is detailed further in [B2.5].

# Post-MVP Features

This document outlines the planned features for KarmaCash beyond the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). These features will be implemented after the core application is stable and functional, with prioritization based on user value and technical feasibility.

## Feature Prioritization

The following features are listed in order of implementation priority:

1. **Shared Budgets** - Highest priority post-MVP feature 
2. **Goal Setting**
3. **Push Notifications**
4. **Basic Reporting**
5. **CSV Import/Reconciliation**

## 1. Shared Budgets (Highest Priority)

### Overview
Enable multiple users to collaboratively manage a single budget, supporting families, couples, roommates, or other household arrangements.

### Key Functionality
- Budget owners can invite other registered users to access and collaborate on their KarmaCash budget.
- Invited users can accept invitations to join a shared budget.
- Transactions added by any member are visible to all members (respecting potential privacy flags if implemented later).
- Budget allocations and spending progress are visible and editable by members based on defined permissions (e.g., owner, editor, viewer).
- All budget calculations properly account for multi-user input where appropriate.

### Technical Implementation Notes
- Requires the architectural shift to a top-level `/budgets/{budgetId}` data structure (planned for M4a).
- Firestore Security rules will be critical for managing permissions based on a `members` map/subcollection within the budget document.
- Transactions will need to link to `budgetId`. Final decision on whether Categories and Recurring Rules also link to `budgetId` or remain user-specific needs confirmation during M4a design. [B5.1]
- Implementation must align with core technical standards ([B2.2], [B2.3]).

### User Stories
- As a budget owner, I want to invite other registered users to access and collaborate on my KarmaCash budget, so we can manage finances together.
- As an invited user, I want to accept an invitation to join a shared budget, so I can view and contribute to it.
- As a member of a shared budget, I want transactions added by any member to be visible to all members with appropriate permissions, so we have a unified financial picture.
- As a member of a shared budget, I want budget allocations and spending progress to be visible and potentially editable based on my role (owner/editor/viewer), fostering collaboration and transparency.

## 2. Goal Setting

### Overview
Allow users to create specific budget categories designated as "Savings Goals" with target amounts and optional target dates, enhancing purposeful saving.

### Key Functionality
- Dedicated UI for creating and managing savings goals (potentially integrated with Category management).
- Define target amount and optional target date per goal.
- Visual progress tracking toward defined goals within the budget view.
- Goal-specific allocation suggestions or tracking.
- Potential timeline projections for goal achievement.

### Technical Implementation Notes
- Likely extends the existing category data model ([B5.2]) with goal-specific fields (`isGoal`, `targetAmount`, `targetDate`).
- Requires specialized handling in the budget allocation UI ([B4b] feature) and reporting/visualization ([M5] feature).
- Will use the animation principles defined in [B3.11] for visual feedback on progress.
- Adheres to core standards ([B2.2], [B2.3]).

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to designate certain budget categories as 'Savings Goals', so I can specifically track progress towards important financial objectives (e.g., Emergency Fund, Vacation).
- As a user, when creating a Savings Goal, I want to set a target amount and optionally a target date, so KarmaCash can help me monitor my progress visually.
- As a user, I want KarmaCash to clearly show how much I've allocated and saved towards my defined Savings Goals, potentially using motivating visuals [B3.11].

## 3. Push Notifications

### Overview
Implement timely, relevant notifications to keep users informed about their budget status and activities, enhancing engagement and financial awareness.

### Key Functionality
- **Shared Budgets:** Notify members when another member adds/updates a significant transaction or modifies budget allocations (user configurable).
- **Recurring Transactions:** Optional reminder on the day a recurring transaction is scheduled or generated.
- **Budget/Goal Alerts:** Optional notification when nearing or exceeding a category budget limit, or when reaching a savings goal milestone.
- **General:** Potential reminders for budget rollover periods.
- **Preferences:** Users can configure which notifications they receive.

### Technical Implementation Notes
- Will utilize Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) requiring setup and potential Cloud Functions for triggering.
- Requires obtaining user permission for notifications (platform-specific).
- Must respect user preferences and privacy settings meticulously.
- Notifications should maintain the Zen/Tranquility theme: informative but non-intrusive design ([B3.4], [B3.8]).
- Adheres to core standards ([B2.2], [B2.3]).

### User Stories
- As a user sharing a budget, I want the option to receive a push notification when another member adds a transaction over a certain amount or modifies the budget, so I can stay informed about our shared finances in real-time.
- As a user, I want to optionally receive a reminder on the day a recurring transaction is due, so I can prepare or verify it.
- As a user, I want the ability to set optional push notification alerts when I approach (e.g., 90%) or exceed a spending category's budget, helping me stay on track.
- As a user, I want to easily manage my notification preferences within KarmaCash to control the frequency and types of alerts I receive.

## 4. Basic Reporting

### Overview
Provide deeper financial insights through expanded reporting and analysis capabilities beyond simple transaction lists and summaries.

### Key Functionality
- Customizable date range selection for reports (beyond default Week/Month).
- Spending trend analysis over selectable periods (e.g., last 3 months, year-to-date) per category or overall.
- Comparison reports (e.g., this month vs. last month, this month vs. budget).
- Potential export functionality for reports (CSV format first, PDF later).

### Technical Implementation Notes
- Will likely build upon visualization components created during M4/M5.
- Requires potentially more complex Firestore queries for data aggregation over longer/custom periods. Query efficiency will be important.
- Export functionality likely handled client-side initially.
- Must maintain the clear, uncluttered aesthetic of KarmaCash ([B3.4]).
- Adheres to core standards ([B2.2], [B2.3]).

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to view my spending trends by category over custom periods (e.g., last 6 months), so I can identify long-term patterns.
- As a user, I want to compare my spending this month to last month or to my budget allocations, so I can understand my progress and habits.
- As a user, I want the ability to export my filtered transaction data or summary reports (e.g., as CSV), so I can perform external analysis or keep records.

## 5. CSV Import/Reconciliation

### Overview
Allow users to import transaction data from CSV files exported from banking platforms and reconcile it with manually tracked transactions within KarmaCash.

### Key Functionality
- UI for uploading a CSV file.
- Field mapping interface to match CSV columns (Date, Description, Amount) to KarmaCash fields.
- Algorithm to attempt matching imported transactions with existing manual entries (based on date, amount, potentially description heuristics).
- Clear UI workflow to review matches, manually link unmatched transactions, approve creation of new transactions from import, or ignore imported rows.
- Avoidance of duplicate entries after reconciliation.

### Technical Implementation Notes
- CSV parsing and processing will happen entirely client-side for privacy (no storage of raw bank files). Libraries like PapaParse can be used.
- The matching algorithm needs careful design to balance accuracy and user effort.
- The reconciliation UI needs to be clear and intuitive, aligning with the Zen theme despite potential complexity ([B3.4], [B3.8]).
- Adheres to core standards ([B2.2], [B2.3]).

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to import a CSV file of transactions downloaded from my bank, so I can verify my manual tracking in KarmaCash.
- As a user, I want KarmaCash to guide me through mapping the columns from my bank's CSV file to the required KarmaCash fields (Date, Description, Amount).
- As a user, I want KarmaCash to automatically suggest matches between imported transactions and existing manual entries based on date and amount.
- As a user, I want a clear interface to review suggested matches, manually link transactions, create new transactions from the import, or ignore imported rows, so I can confidently reconcile my data.

## Additional Post-MVP Considerations

### Authentication Enhancements
- Social login options (e.g., Google Sign-In).
- More robust account recovery mechanisms.

### User Experience Refinements
- Customizable dashboard layout.
- More diverse chart/visualization options in the 'Graphiques' section.
- Dark mode support (respecting theme).

### Financial Mindfulness Features
- Optional reflective prompts during transaction entry (e.g., "How does this purchase align with your goals?").
- Guided periodic financial review/"check-in" workflows.
- Feature to set personal financial intentions or values.

These future enhancements will continue to build on the core Zen/Tranquility theme, expanding functionality while maintaining the calm, focused approach to financial management that defines KarmaCash.

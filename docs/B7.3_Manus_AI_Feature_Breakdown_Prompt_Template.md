# [B7.3] Manus AI Feature/Milestone Breakdown Prompt Template

This template guides the process of using Manus AI to break down a high-level feature or milestone into actionable Task Master tasks. It emphasizes an initial Q&A step for clarification.

## Stage 1: Initial Prompt to Manus AI (for Clarifying Questions)

```text
Hi Manus AI,

We are planning to work on the following high-level feature/milestone for our KarmaCash PWA: **"[INSERT HIGH-LEVEL FEATURE/MILESTONE NAME/GOAL HERE]"**

**Brief Context:**
*   This is part of our overall Project Milestone: [e.g., M5 - Analyse et Polissage].
*   Current state of related app areas: [Provide 1-2 sentences of essential context, e.g., "The application currently has [X existing functionality related to this feature]" or "This is a brand new feature."].
*   Relevant Bible Sections for general principles (do not generate tasks based on these yet, just for your understanding of the project space): [e.g., B3.4 UI Guidelines, B2.1 Project Vision].

Before you attempt to break this down into sub-tasks, I need your help to ensure we have a clear and shared understanding of the specific requirements and desired outcomes.

**Your first action:** Please review this high-level goal and the provided context. Then, ask me (the Human Developer) a set of 3-5 pertinent clarifying questions. These questions should help you understand:
*   Specific pain points this feature aims to solve or user needs it addresses.
*   The desired 'feel,' key characteristics, or critical success factors for this feature.
*   Any specific technical approaches, patterns, libraries, or constraints I might already have in mind or that are dictated by existing architecture.
*   The precise scope and boundaries of this feature (what's in, what's out for this iteration).
*   Any non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, accessibility, specific Bible docs to adhere to for implementation details).

Please ONLY provide these clarifying questions in your first response. Do not generate any tasks or solutions yet. Once I answer your questions, I will provide them to you and then ask you to proceed with the detailed task breakdown.
Use code with caution.

Stage 2: Second Prompt to Manus AI (with Answers + Request for Task Breakdown)
Hi Manus AI,

Thank you for your clarifying questions regarding the "[INSERT HIGH-LEVEL FEATURE/MILESTONE NAME/GOAL HERE]" feature/milestone. Here are my answers:

--- START OF HD ANSWERS ---
[HD: Paste the questions from Manus AI and your detailed answers here. Be as specific as possible.]
Question 1 from Manus: ...
HD Answer 1: ...

Question 2 from Manus: ...
HD Answer 2: ...
... (and so on for all questions) ...
--- END OF HD ANSWERS ---

Now, based on this clarified direction from my answers, please break down the high-level feature/milestone **"[INSERT HIGH-LEVEL FEATURE/MILESTONE NAME/GOAL HERE]"** into a series of approximately [HD: Specify target number, e.g., 5-10] detailed, actionable sub-tasks.

These sub-tasks will be managed in our Task Master system. Therefore, please use the following format precisely for EACH sub-task. Each task block must start with `--- START OF TASK ---` and end with `--- END OF TASK ---`.

--- START OF TASK ---
# Title: [Sub-task Ref (e.g., FTR-X.1) and Clear, Actionable Title]
# Priority: [high/medium/low - Your best estimate based on logical flow]
# Dependencies: [List other sub-task Titles/Refs it depends on, or "None"]
# Description: [Concise 1-2 sentence description of the sub-task's primary goal.]
# Details:
# - [Bulleted list of specific technical/design actions or considerations for this step.]
# - [Explicitly reference relevant HD Answers (e.g., "Based on HD Answer #X regarding Y...").]
# - [Reference specific, relevant Bible sections to be consulted/updated for this task, e.g., `B3.7`, `B5.2`, `B6.1`].
# - [If new components are created, suggest a name, e.g., "New React Component: `MyNewComponent.jsx`".]
# Mockup/Design Needed: [Yes/No/Partially - If Yes/Partially, briefly describe what visuals are needed or reference mockup file if available (e.g., from AI Mockup Generation cycle - Step C.3 in B7.1 workflow).]
# Test Strategy:
# - [How to verify *this specific sub-task* is complete? e.g., "Confirm new component X renders correctly with Y data." "Confirm API endpoint Z returns expected response." "Confirm B5.X is updated with new data model."].
# - [Note any required Bible Updates *resulting from this step's completion* (e.g., "B3.7 updated with spec for `MyNewComponent.jsx`").]
--- END OF TASK ---

**Instructions for Sub-Task Content:**
1.  **Sequence:** Please sequence the sub-tasks logically (e.g., design/planning tasks before implementation, backend before frontend if clear dependencies exist).
2.  **Granularity:** Aim for tasks that represent a manageable chunk of work for a developer in one or a few focused sessions.
3.  **Mockup Consideration:** For each task, thoughtfully fill in the `Mockup/Design Needed:` field. Consider our workflow of using AI-generated mockups as a starting point and reference them if applicable.
4.  **Technical Detail:** For implementation tasks, try to be specific about technologies, libraries (if known from HD answers or Bible context), or architectural patterns to consider.
5.  **Bible Integration:** Actively suggest Bible sections that need to be consulted during the task or updated upon its completion.
6.  **Deliverables:** Ensure the sub-tasks collectively lead to a fully implemented and tested feature/milestone as per the clarified vision.

Please generate ONLY the formatted text output containing all identified sub-tasks.

# Healthy Work Practices

This document outlines healthy work practices for the KarmaCash development process, focusing on sustainable development rhythms, well-being, and effectiveness.

## 1. Sustainable Development Approach

### 1.1 Focused Time Blocks

KarmaCash development follows a structured approach using dedicated time blocks:

- **Primary Development Window**: 20:00-22:00 daily
- **Session Duration**: 2 hours maximum per session
- **Weekly Cadence**: 5-6 sessions per week, with at least one full day of rest

This approach recognizes that quality often comes from focused, consistent effort rather than extended marathon sessions.

### 1.2 Session Structure

Each development session should follow this general structure:

1. **Review & Planning** (10-15 minutes):
   - Review SHIP document from previous session
   - Set clear goals for the current session
   - Prepare development environment

2. **Focused Development** (80-90 minutes):
   - Work on prioritized tasks from the session plan
   - Implement in small, testable increments
   - Document progress and decisions

3. **Closure & Handoff** (10-15 minutes):
   - Commit changes with clear messages
   - Update SHIP document for next session
   - Document any blockers or open questions

### 1.3 Progress Measurement

Progress should be measured by:

- **Milestone Completion**: Progress through defined milestones
- **Core Functionality**: Working features that deliver user value
- **Quality Metrics**: Low defect rate and maintainable code
- **Knowledge Capture**: Updated documentation reflecting decisions

The focus should be on sustainable velocity rather than arbitrary deadlines.

## 2. Physical Well-being Practices

### 2.1 Ergonomic Setup

Ensure a proper ergonomic work environment:

- **Chair and Desk**: Properly adjusted for correct posture
- **Monitor**: Positioned at eye level, arm's length away
- **Keyboard and Mouse**: Positioned to minimize strain
- **Lighting**: Adequate, non-glare lighting to reduce eye strain

### 2.2 Regular Movement

Incorporate movement into the development routine:

- **Micro-breaks**: Brief stretches every 25-30 minutes
- **20-20-20 Rule**: Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds
- **Standing Intervals**: Alternate between sitting and standing if possible
- **Post-Session Movement**: 5-10 minutes of physical activity after each session

### 2.3 Physical Environment

Create a supportive physical environment:

- **Air Quality**: Well-ventilated workspace
- **Temperature**: Comfortable temperature (68-72°F / 20-22°C)
- **Hydration**: Water readily available during development sessions
- **Background Noise**: Appropriate sound environment (quiet or consistent background)

## 3. Mental Well-being Practices

### 3.1 Focus Enhancement

Support mental focus during development:

- **Distraction Management**: Disable notifications during sessions
- **Context Switching**: Minimize switching between unrelated tasks
- **Deep Work Mode**: Establish rituals that signal "deep work" time
- **Pomodoro Technique**: Consider 25-minute focus periods with 5-minute breaks

### 3.2 Stress Management

Manage development-related stress:

- **Scope Boundaries**: Set realistic session goals to avoid feeling overwhelmed
- **Problem Decomposition**: Break complex problems into manageable pieces
- **Challenging Code Approaches**: Take a brief break when stuck, then try a different angle
- **Progress Perspective**: Focus on incremental progress rather than completion pressure

### 3.3 Mental Recharge

Incorporate mental recharge practices:

- **Session Bookends**: Brief mindfulness moments before and after sessions
- **Context Clearing**: End sessions with a clear stopping point and next steps
- **Tech Boundaries**: Establish non-tech time outside development windows
- **Nature Connection**: Spend time outdoors regularly to reset mental focus

## 4. AI Collaboration Health

### 4.1 Balanced Collaboration

Maintain healthy human-AI collaboration:

- **Decision Ownership**: Human developer makes final decisions on approach and implementation
- **Critical Evaluation**: Critically evaluate AI suggestions rather than blindly accepting
- **Skill Development**: Use AI as a learning tool, not just a solution provider
- **Understanding Priority**: Focus on understanding code, not just producing it

### 4.2 Effective Prompting

Develop healthy prompting habits:

- **Clear Requests**: Formulate clear, specific requests
- **Context Provision**: Provide sufficient context without overwhelming
- **Incremental Collaboration**: Build complex solutions through iterative exchanges
- **Learning Focus**: Frame requests to facilitate learning, not just completion

### 4.3 Knowledge Integration

Ensure knowledge stays with the human developer:

- **Code Review Practice**: Thoroughly review all AI-generated code
- **Mental Models**: Build mental models of how systems work, don't just implement suggestions
- **Documentation Ownership**: Maintain human ownership of project documentation
- **Conceptual Understanding**: Focus on understanding concepts, not just implementations

## 5. Project Management Health

### 5.1 Scope Management

Maintain healthy scope boundaries:

- **MVP Focus**: Maintain discipline on MVP features
- **Feature Creep Awareness**: Be conscious of and resist feature creep
- **Completion Definition**: Define clear completion criteria for tasks
- **Parking Lot**: Maintain a "parking lot" for good ideas that are out of current scope

### 5.2 Decision Management

Make decisions sustainably:

- **Decision Fatigue**: Recognize and mitigate decision fatigue
- **Appropriate Deliberation**: Match deliberation time to decision importance
- **Decision Documentation**: Document significant decisions in [B7.3 Decision Log]
- **Reversibility Awareness**: Consider decision reversibility when determining time investment

### 5.3 Progress Perspective

Maintain a healthy perspective on progress:

- **Milestone Celebration**: Celebrate milestone completions
- **Progress Visualization**: Maintain visual indicators of progress
- **Setback Perspective**: View setbacks as learning opportunities
- **Comparison Avoidance**: Avoid unhealthy comparison to other projects or timelines

## 6. Learning Practices

### 6.1 Deliberate Learning

Incorporate deliberate learning:

- **Targeted Skill Development**: Identify key skills to develop during the project
- **Learning Time**: Allocate specific time for learning (outside regular sessions)
- **Knowledge Consolidation**: Periodically review and consolidate learnings
- **Documentation Updates**: Update documentation with new knowledge

### 6.2 Reflection Practices

Build in reflection practices:

- **Weekly Reviews**: Brief weekly review of progress and learnings
- **Milestone Retrospectives**: More detailed reflection at milestone completions
- **Technical Retrospectives**: Specific reflection on technical approaches
- **Journaling**: Consider maintaining a development journal for personal insights

### 6.3 Knowledge Sharing

Share knowledge effectively:

- **Clear Documentation**: Document learnings clearly for future reference
- **Code Comments**: Include meaningful comments that explain "why," not just "what"
- **Architecture Clarity**: Document architectural decisions and patterns
- **Bible Updates**: Regularly update the Bible with new insights and decisions

# [B7.4] AI Mockup Prompt Template (for ChatGPT/DALL-E or similar)

This template provides a structured starting point for prompting AI image generation tools to create UI mockups for KarmaCash features.

## 1. Core Instruction & AI Persona

"Hi [AI Tool Name, e.g., ChatGPT],

*   **Key Visual Principles:** [e.g., Flat design with subtle elevations, rounded corners for cards/buttons, clean lines].
*   **Primary Colors (Ref: [B3.8 Style Guide v2]):**
    *   App Background: [e.g., Soft off-white (approx. #F3F0E8)]
    *   Surface Color (for cards, interactive elements): [e.g., Pure white (approx. #FFFFFF)]
    *   Primary Action/Accent Color: [e.g., Muted Sage Green (approx. #919A7F)]

    *   Body Text Font (if relevant for mockup): [e.g., 'IBM Plex Serif']
*   **(Optional) Link to or embed key app screenshots for visual reference if platform allows.**

## 3. Canvas & Device

*   **Device:** [e.g., iPhone screen canvas, Android screen canvas, Desktop browser window]
*   **Device Appearance:** [e.g., With a clear black outline of the device frame]
*   **Orientation:** [e.g., Portrait, Landscape (if applicable)]

## 4. UI Element to Mockup: [Name of the Element, e.g., Bottom Tab Bar, New Transaction Form, Settings Screen]

### 4.1. Style & Appearance of the Element
*   [Describe desired background color, border, shadow, overall shape, relation to other elements (e.g., "elevated surface")]
*   [Reference existing component styles if it should be consistent, e.g., "Should match existing card styling from app screenshots."]

### 4.2. Specific Components & Content within the Element
*   **Item 1:** [e.g., Tab 1 for Bottom Bar]
    *   Label (Text & Language): [e.g., "Budget" (French: "Budget")]
    *   Icon Style: [e.g., Heroicons (Outline variant)]
    *   Specific Icon Suggestion: [e.g., Wallet, piggy bank]
    *   Interaction States to Show (if applicable): [e.g., Active, Inactive]
*   **Item 2:** [e.g., Input Field for Form]
    *   Label: [e.g., "Amount"]
    *   Placeholder Text: [e.g., "0.00"]
    *   Expected Input Type: [e.g., Numeric]
*   **(Add more items as needed for the element)**

### 4.3. Specific States or Variations to Illustrate (if generating multiple mockups)
*   **Mockup View 1:** [e.g., Bottom Tab Bar - "Budget" Tab Active]
    *   [Describe specific active/inactive states, content placeholders for this view]
*   **Mockup View 2:** [e.g., Bottom Tab Bar - "Graphs" Tab Active]
    *   [Describe differences from View 1]
*   **(Add more views as needed)**

### 4.4. Advanced Visual Effects (Optional)
*   [e.g., "Subtle frosted glass effect (backdrop blur) for the element's background"]
*   [e.g., "Subtle gradient for section background"]

## 5. Overall Impression & Negative Constraints

*   "The mockups should look professional, clean, modern, and perfectly embody the '[App Theme, e.g., Zen/Tranquility]' theme. Avoid visual noise, overly complex details, or styles inconsistent with the provided app context and Bible references."

## 6. Output Format

*   [e.g., "Please provide the output as PNG images."]
*   [e.g., "If possible, generate images with a transparent background for the app screen content area, just showing the device frame and the UI element itself."]

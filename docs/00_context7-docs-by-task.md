## Using These Recommendations

1. Have Cursor run the relevant Context7 queries at the beginning of each task implementation
2. Refer back to the documentation as needed during development
3. Update these queries if you encounter specific technical challenges

This approach ensures that Cursor's implementations follow current best practices while leveraging the capabilities of Context7 to access the most up-to-date documentation.

# Roadmap & Milestones

## Development Approach

KarmaCash follows a structured, milestone-based approach to ensure steady progress and create functional components that build upon each other. This phased approach allows for clear tracking of progress and ensures that the application grows in a logical, sustainable manner. Key architectural decisions may necessitate pivoting the roadmap, as occurred before starting Milestone 4.

## Milestone Overview (Revised Post-M3)

### Pre-M4 Completed Milestones:
- **Milestone 0: Setup & Foundation:** Initial project setup, repo, environment, logging foundation. (Complete)
- **Milestone 1: Authentication & Basic Layout:** Firebase auth, core layout, navigation, user context, protected routes. (Complete)
- **Milestone 2: Core Data (Initial):** User-centric category & transaction CRUD, default categories, UI implementation, toast notifications. (Complete - *Note: Data is user-centric*)
- **Milestone 3: Recurring Transactions & Enhanced Transaction View:** Recurring rules CRUD, UI-triggered Callable Function for generation/deletion, Enhanced Weekly/Monthly views (Calendar), UTC date fixes. (Complete - *Note: Built on user-centric data*)

### --- Architectural Pivot Point (Pre-M4) ---
*Recognized need to refactor core data structure to support high-priority **Shared Budgets** before implementing budgeting features.*

### Milestone 4a: Architectural Refactor for Shared Budgets (Current Focus)
- **Goal:** Redesign and implement the core data structure in Firestore to support collaborative budgeting. This is foundational for future scaling and features.
- **Key Outcomes:** Top-level `budgets` collection, clear membership/permission model, defined relationships for associated data (transactions, categories).

### Milestone 4b: Core Budgeting Logic & UI
- **Goal:** Develop the primary budgeting features, leveraging the new shared data structure.
- **Key Outcomes:** Monthly budget page, category allocation UI, accurate ZBB calculations (Available Funds, Rollover), spending tracking visuals.

### Milestone 5: Analysis Sections & Navigation Polish
- **Goal:** Provide users with insightful data visualization and refine the overall application navigation and user experience.
- **Key Outcomes:** 'Graphiques' section with charts, 'Catégories' analysis view, polished navigation/header controls.

### Milestone 6: Final Testing, Refinement & Deployment
- **Goal:** Ensure a high-quality, reliable MVP ready for initial use or deployment.
- **Key Outcomes:** Thoroughly tested application, final UI polish, performance optimizations, production deployment.

## Detailed Task Breakdown (Revised Post-M3)

*(Tasks for M0-M3 remain as completed historically)*

### Milestone 4a: Architectural Refactor for Shared Budgets (NEW)
- **Design:**
    - Define Firestore schema for top-level `budgets` collection ([B5.2]).
    - Define Membership/Permissions model (e.g., `members` map/subcollection with roles) ([B5.2]).
    - Finalize relationship/linkage strategy for `transactions` to `budgets` ([B5.1]).
    - Determine if `categories` and `recurringRules` need budget linkage or remain user-specific ([B5.1]).
    - Update Bible Data Model section ([B5.X]) with designs & rationale.
    - Define high-level Firestore Security Rules strategy for shared access ([B5.X]).
- **Implementation:**
    - Implement necessary changes to Firestore Schema/Indexes.
    - Refactor `transactionService.js` to handle new linkage to `budgets`.
    - Refactor `categoryService.js` / `recurringRules.js` if linkage changes decided.
    - Implement updated Firestore Security Rules based on design strategy.
- **Testing:**
    - Unit/Integration tests for refactored services.
    - Manual validation of data relationships and security rules.

### Milestone 4b: Core Budgeting Logic & UI (WAS M4)
- *(Prerequisite: M4a Completion)*
- Create `BudgetPage.jsx` UI structure (placeholder areas for funds, categories).
- Implement fetching of relevant `budget` document based on selected month & user access.
- Implement logic/UI for displaying `Available Funds` (Requires careful definition - [B6.1]).
- Implement logic/UI for displaying/handling `Rollover` from previous month ([B6.1]).
- Build `BudgetCategoryRow.jsx` component.
- Implement UI for Category Allocation (e.g., input field per category).
- Implement logic for "Remaining to Allocate" calculation & display (real-time updates).
- Implement saving of allocations to the `budget` document ([B5.2]).
- Implement display of Spending vs. Allocation per category (Requires transaction data query linked to `budgetId` and categories).
- Add basic progress indicators for category spending.
- Add Month Navigation controls for the Budget page.
- Implement core Budget Calculation test cases ([B7.2]).
- Add visual feedback for budget status (e.g., category over/under budget) ([B3.8]).

### Milestone 5: Analysis Sections & Navigation Polish (WAS M5)
- *(Prerequisite: M4b Completion)*
- Implement 'Graphiques' section UI.
- Add Expense Distribution Pie Chart (fetching relevant transactions).
- Add Income vs. Expense vs. Balance Bar Chart.
- Implement 'Catégories' section UI.
- Display transactions grouped by category within selected period.
- Implement Header Balance Toggle (logic might depend on budgeting calcs from M4b).
- Implement View Mode/Date Persistence across sections (if not done earlier).
- Enhance Navigation UX (transitions, active states).
- Responsive design refinements based on populated views.

### Milestone 6: Final Testing, Refinement & Deployment (WAS M7)
- *(Prerequisite: M5 Completion)*
- End-to-end testing of all core user flows (Auth, Tx, Budgeting).
- Cross-browser & Multi-device testing.
- Final UI polish (animations, transitions, visual consistency review).
- Performance review & optimization (lazy loading, code splitting, query optimization).
- Firestore Security Rules final review and hardening.
- Comprehensive error handling review.
- Production environment setup/configuration.
- Deployment to Firebase Hosting.
- Basic maintenance/backup plan documentation.

## Timeline Estimate (Revised Post-M3)

- **Milestone 4a (Refactor):** ~4-7 sessions (8-14 hours) - *High uncertainty, critical path.*
- **Milestone 4b (Budgeting):** ~7-10 sessions (14-20 hours) - *Similar to original M4 estimate.*
- **Milestone 5 (Analysis):** ~5-7 sessions (10-14 hours) - *Depends on complexity.*
- **Milestone 6 (Testing/Deploy):** ~3-5 sessions (6-10 hours) - *Standard estimate.*

**Revised Estimated MVP (M0-M6) Range**: Approximately 38-59 sessions (76-118 hours). Note this incorporates the significant refactoring effort. *Actual duration highly dependent on M4a complexity.*

## Development Dependencies (Revised)

1.  **M0-M3 → M4a (Refactor)**: The user-centric implementation works but limits future features. Refactor is needed for sharing.
2.  **M4a (Refactor) → M4b (Budgeting)**: Core budgeting *must* be built on the new shared data architecture.
3.  **M4b (Budgeting) → M5 (Analysis)**: Analysis views depend on budget data and related transactions being correctly structured and calculated.
4.  **M5 → M6 (Testing/Deploy)**: All core features needed for comprehensive testing before deployment.

## Post-MVP Roadmap

Following the MVP (completion of M6), development will focus on features prioritized in [B1.4], beginning with Shared Budget UI/UX refinements (permissions management, invites etc.), Goal Setting, and Push Notifications.

Task Objective: Implement the Cloud Functions API for the Template Exchange System

Key Changes Made:
- Created a comprehensive REST API for template management using Firebase Cloud Functions
- Implemented secure authentication middleware using API keys with caching for better performance
- Built a robust template service layer with CRUD operations and business logic
- Developed API endpoints for retrieving, creating, listing, updating, and deleting templates
- Implemented pagination, validation, and error handling throughout the API
- Created thorough test suite with mocks for both API and service layers
- Documented the API with comprehensive reference docs and deployment guide

Implementation Details:
1. Created API endpoints:
   - GET /api/templates/:sessionId - Retrieve template by session ID
   - POST /api/templates - Create new template
   - GET /api/templates - List templates with filtering
   - PUT /api/templates/:id - Update existing template
   - DELETE /api/templates/:id - Delete template

2. Implemented authentication:
   - Developed middleware for API key validation
   - Added caching to reduce Firestore reads
   - Ensured proper error handling for auth failures

3. Built service layer:
   - Created business logic for template operations
   - Implemented validation for all template operations
   - Optimized queries using the sharding strategy from FTR-7.1

4. Created documentation:
   - API reference with endpoints, parameters, and examples
   - Comprehensive deployment guide with setup instructions
   - Test coverage with mock objects for isolated testing

5. Added tooling for API management:
   - Created script for API key generation and management
   - Implemented configuration management for production settings

Additional Work Completed:
- Added proper Cloud Functions configuration with timeouts and memory settings
- Implemented proper error handling with detailed error messages
- Added ISO date string formatting for consistent API responses
- Created structured pagination support for listing endpoints
- Built test infrastructure with mocks for Express request/response objects

Next Steps:
- Implement client libraries for consuming the API (FTR-7.4)
- Add integration tests for API endpoints (FTR-7.7)
- Implement monitoring and analytics for API usage (FTR-7.8)
- Consider adding caching layer for high-traffic endpoints

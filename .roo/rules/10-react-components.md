# React Component Standards

- **Structure:** Follow feature-based structure (`src/features/...`). Shared components go in `src/components/ui/`. See [B2.5].
- **Styling:** Use CSS Modules exclusively. File names must end with `.module.css`. See [B2.5].
- **Functional Components:** Use functional components with hooks.
- **Zen UI:** Components should adhere to Zen UI principles (Clarity, Minimalism). See [B3.4], [B3.8].
- **Data Fetching:** Prefer custom hooks (`use...`) for data fetching logic.

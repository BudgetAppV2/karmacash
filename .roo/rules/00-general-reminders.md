# General KarmaCash Reminders

- **Project Vision:** KarmaCash: PWA for simplified, mindful ZBB, French-first. [B1.1]
- **Guiding Principles:** Zen UI (Calm, Minimalist, Clarity, Responsive, Consistent). [B3.4], [B3.8 v2], [B2.1].
- **UTC Dates:** ALWAYS use UTC for storing and manipulating dates. Use date-fns library where possible. See [B2.3].
- **Signed Amounts:** ALL monetary amounts stored in Firestore MUST be signed (+/-). Income is positive, Expenses are negative. See [B5.2].
- **Logging:** Use the established logging pattern for Cloud Functions and frontend. See [B4.4].
- **Tech Debt:** Be mindful of the dual `active`/`isActive` field usage; aim for `isActive` where possible. [Ref: Persistent Notes]
- **Bible:** Refer to the project Bible for detailed standards:
